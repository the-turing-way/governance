# **Hidden REF Competition 2024**

The Hidden REF was launched to raise awareness of the research outputs and roles that are vital to research but overlooked by traditional research evaluation. We want to build a more effective and more equitable system for recognising contributions to research success. Please take part in the competition if you work in research and want to raise awareness of your own work or the work of others.
