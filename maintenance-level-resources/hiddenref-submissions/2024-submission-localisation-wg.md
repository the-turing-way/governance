## Summary

**In up to 300 words, please describe your submission to this category and the reasons how it (or the person you have nominated) have contributed to the success of research.**

I am nominating The Turing Way's Translation and Localisation Working Group, led by Batool Almarzouq and Andrea Sanchez-Tapia for their critical contributions in making *The Turing Way* more globally accessible. *The Turing Way* is an open-source project housed at The Alan Turing Institute, offering practical guides on reproducibility, ethics, and collaborative research. The project’s success extends beyond the UK, reaching diverse communities through its translation and localisation efforts.

The Localisation Working Group, initiated in 2021, has enabled *The Turing Way* to be translated into 8 languages, expanding its reach across regions beyond the United Kingdom. The group has developed workflows, governance structures, and tools to support community-driven translation, ensuring that international contributors can participate meaningfully and with recognition. The team is an active part of our community, conducting bi-weekly co-working calls and regularly presenting at international conferences, including CarpentryCon, Write the Docs, and FORCE11.

This working group’s success lies in its dual focus: co-governing the human infrastructure to ensure inclusivity and visibility, and integrating technical tools to streamline multilingual deployments. The co-leads of the localisation working group in particular have played a vital leadership role in advancing these efforts, making the knowledge and tools in *The Turing Way* accessible to communities traditionally excluded by language barriers.

The group's localisation guidelines and technical solutions, such as the deployment of the Arabic version, demonstrate their commitment to enhancing the usability of the project across different cultural and linguistic contexts, benefiting both *The Turing Way* and other similar open-source initiatives.

The work of the Translation and Localisation Working Group of The Turing Way addresses a critical imbalance in scientific communication, where the dominance of English marginalises non-native speakers as well as excludes vast segments of the global community from contributing to and accessing scientific knowledge. In highlighting the work of this group of volunteers, this submission highlights the broader significance of translation and localisation work as a form of supporting knowledge equity and broader access to data science guidance outside of English-speaking contexts. 

In particular, this submission highlights the contributions of the Translation and Localisation Working Group in the following categories:

Local Importance

Localising open access scientific resources is crucial for addressing place-based knowledge gaps. The group's work is particularly important for the Global South, where access to research and educational resources is often restricted due to language barriers. In translating The Turing Way, the group addresses local needs and allows regional scientists and practitioners to engage with high-quality data science and reproducibility practices.

Localisation goes beyond mere text translation; it involves making knowledge culturally relevant to facilitate broader knowledge exchange. In some cases, such as with Arabic, this requires developing new terms to express concepts that currently lack equivalents in the language. For open science practices and principles, the necessary vocabulary doesn’t exist in Arabic, so it must be developed and included in glossaries

The Turing Way Translation and Localisation Working Group is at the forefront of this multifaceted work, guiding these discussions and processes alongside community members with lived experiences of exclusion due to language and/or other barriers related to linguistic and cultural difference or racism.

Leadership

The leadership demonstrated by co-leads and volunteers Batool Almarzouq and Andrea Sanchez-Tapia has been exceptional, extending far beyond the working group itself. 

Furthermore, after a period of immense growth for the project broadly, the Translation and Localisation Working Group was the first to incubate governance structures that have since inspired similar work across the project more broadly. In a multi-lingual, multidisciplinary environment, the working group has implemented internal structures that promote inclusive decision-making and value the contributions of marginalised voices as a default. 

By fostering collaboration across multiple regions and time zones, the group is empowering communities from the Global South and non-native English-speaking regions to actively participate in open science and knowledge production.

Reflexive & Positional and Temporality

I have witnessed first hand how reflective the Translation and Localisation Working Group is in its approach to improving The Turing Way resources. Their ongoing governance work begins from a place of critically addressing global knowledge disparities, reflecting on how their work can help dismantle the power imbalances between the Global North and Global South in the context of scientific production. 

Their work is highly relational, and situated in the long-term relationships that the co-leads have developed with each other and within the community. Indeed, aside from being valuable community members who have contributed extensively to community resources, they have led cross-community collaborations with other community working Groups: collaborating with the Infrastructure Working Group to develop infrastructure to support multilingual implementation of the guides, as well as the Accessibility Working Group to develop best practices for inclusive work.

By addressing the multifaceted challenges of language barriers, cultural contexts, and power imbalances in global scientific communication, Batool Almarzouq and Andrea Sanchez Tapia along with The Turing Way’s Translation and Localisation Working Group are making significant strides towards a more equitable and inclusive research landscape.


### Please describe how/why this submission is overlooked/hidden within current research culture and evaluation approaches. *

Please provide the above information against the Hidden REF criteria (up to 600 words between 1. and 2.)

While The Turing Way itself is a non-traditional resource that is often overlooked in traditional academic publishing, the work of the Translation and Localisation Working Group is hidden twice-over. They embody both an urgent need, as well as a hidden role that is often overlooked in both traditional research culture as well as in open science.

The Translation and Localisation Working Group, co-lead by Batool Almarzouq and Andrea Sanchez-Tapia have demonstrated firsthand how to make research guidance accessible and inclusive across diverse global communities. 

While research culture in the United Kingdom operates within an English speaking context, stewarding the development of resources that can reach diverse audiences outside of the Anglophone sphere, and ensure broader participation in the research process. This work of expanding and translating existing work, does not fit within conventional metrics for research evaluation, which tend to privilege generating publications and new outputs written in English alone.

Indeed, despite the essential nature of their contributions, traditional research evaluations often overlook translation and localisation work, even more so in the context of open access resources like *The Turing Way*. These contributions do not result in original research papers, nor do they typically receive authorship credit in publications, even though their work significantly enhances the reach, inclusivity, and usability of such work. The value of their contributions is not easily captured by citation metrics or impact factors, yet their role is vital in broadening participation in global research ecosystems, and enabling knowledge equity.

# Notes

*  DIIF application

The group’s localisation efforts directly confronts the ethical challenge of English-language dominance in scientific communication. As research highlights (Huttner-Koros & Perera, 2016; Amano et al., 2023), the over-reliance on English excludes non-native speakers from knowledge production. The group's work in localising The Turing Way into eight languages, adapting content to reflect diverse cultural contexts, and co-governing the process ensures that resources are accessible and ethically aligned with global needs.

From its beginnings, community members worked to translate the book into their native languages, in efforts that were frequently isolated and depended on time availability. To build on this work, a localisation working group was formed in 2021, offering support, visibility, and continuity to these efforts. Currently facilitating translations in 8 languages, the group conducts bi-weekly coworking calls and engages in international conferences like Write The Docs, CarpentriesCons, FORCE11, FOSS, and Durham RIOTS Club. The Turing Way localisation working group has put significant effort into two aspects. One is the team’s **governance**, to co-govern the human infrastructure mobilised in the localisation efforts, and ensure that everyone involved is acknowledged, consulted and included. The second is **infrastructure** integration,** **the technical publishing tools used in our workflows. Each team is encouraged to create localisation guidelines to record decisions around technical jargon, cultural nuance, and other considerations (such as gender-neutral expressions in gendered languages). A deployment in Arabic can be seen at [https://turingway-arabic.netlify.app/welcome.html](https://turingway-arabic.netlify.app/welcome.html), and the corresponding localisation guidelines at [https://github.com/TWTranslation/Arabic-specific-Translation-rules](https://github.com/TWTranslation/Arabic-specific-Translation-rules).
