## Summary

**In up to 300 words, please describe your submission to this category and the reasons how it (or the person you have nominated) have contributed to the success of research.**

I am nominating The Turing Way's (TTW) Accessibility Working Group for the "Everything else!" category, with Liz Hare as its representative, for their work in highlighting accessibility-related needs and practices used to remove those barriers.

The Turing Way is a globally recognised, open science project based at The Alan Turing Institute. Its community-driven data science handbook includes over 350 chapters across five guides on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration, and Ethical Research. Since its inception, The Turing Way has supported multiple initiatives, including working groups that contribute to making research more inclusive and accessible.

Liz Hare, co-lead of the Accessibility Working Group, has been instrumental in advancing accessibility in research. She organised a 2022 workshop at The Turing Way’s bi-annual contribution event with Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, focusing on accessibility for disabled researchers in data science (workshop recording: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARMs7C\_wE04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARMs7C\_wE04)). This prompted the formation of the Accessibility Working Group in early 2023, which has most recently culminated in a Fireside Chat discussion on aligned topics (talk recording: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac9czT3Tr8A\&list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dl521skBqViIQVsSUZ-VYi2\&index=1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac9czT3Tr8A\&list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dl521skBqViIQVsSUZ-VYi2\&index=1)). The Accessibility Working Group has also provided guidance about which collaborative tools are accessible, planning for the bi-annual contribution event, and how to use collaboration tools like Slack in accessible ways.

The working group has since tackled key challenges in open science, developing processes to improve accessibility for contributors facing various barriers. It brings together experts and researchers from diverse backgrounds, including those from low-to-middle-income countries, to address accessibility in a broader sense as well as ensure that disabled researchers can participate in shaping data science practices and research.

The Accessibility Working Group has been integral in shaping how accessibility is considered and implemented within The Turing Way, extending into the broader ecosystem of open science and data science research. This submission highlights the critical and often invisible work of fostering accessibility and inclusion within *The Turing Way* community and open science broadly. 

Liz Hare, alongside the Accessibility Working Group have taken a proactive role in shifting the conversation towards considering accessibility not as an afterthought, but as an integral component of research. This submission aims to highlight a non-traditional but crucial output: accessibility practices that are rarely measured by traditional research metrics but have a far-reaching impact on both the research community and the quality of research produced.

**Appropriateness**:

The working group’s efforts to build accessible practices reflect the highest ethical and research standards. By setting standards for inclusive processes, the development of the working group's Accessibility Policy and developing guidance related to accessible and inclusive practices ensure that researchers of all abilities and backgrounds can engage meaningfully with data science and research. This work is coherent with broader trends in open science and reflects a commitment to addressing the needs of underrepresented groups, especially those with disabilities.


**Leadership**:

Liz Hare’s leadership is noteworthy for going above and beyond. Her workshop in 2022, alongside Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, set the foundation for the Accessibility Working Group, offering guidance on how to think critically about inclusivity in the field of data science. By advocating for this crucial aspect of research and engaging with a global community, Liz has demonstrated a clear vision for how open science can be made accessible to all, particularly those traditionally excluded from this space.

**Reflexivity and Positionality**:

The group operates within a reflexive framework, constantly evaluating and refining its approach during monthly meetings. This reflection is evident in how the group assesses its work, ensuring that it remains open to feedback and that its processes evolve as the needs of the community change. Furthermore, their emergent accessibility policy is rooted in rigour, continuously updated in line with new technologies and feedback from the community. Their process recognises that accessibility is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing process that requires community engagement, transparency, and accountability. 

**Responsibility**:

The group has demonstrated a strong commitment to responsible research, ensuring that accessibility practices are designed to serve a much broader research community. Their efforts are grounded in principles of research integrity and social responsibility, reflecting an awareness of the structural barriers that exist for researchers with disabilities. By addressing these barriers, the group contributes to the creation of a more ethical research ecosystem, where diverse voices can shape the research agenda.

**Temporality**:

The impact of this working group goes beyond immediate outputs; it is rooted in the long-term relationships and continuous contributions of its members. The creation of the group itself stems from ongoing efforts within The Turing Way to be inclusive and responsive to the needs of its community. Their approach ensures that the work is not simply a one-off intervention but part of a sustained effort to improve accessibility in open science over time. "Moving at the speed of trust", particularly with community members has been integral to the sustainability of this vounteer-led group.

The Turing Way’s Accessibility Working Group has made significant contributions by fostering a global community that can engage with data science regardless of physical, cognitive, geographical, linguistic, or other barriers. 

## Please describe how/why this submission is overlooked/hidden within current research culture and evaluation approaches.

The Turing Way community defines accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioral, social and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome to enter and participate in research, data-driven processes, communities and events despite any barriers for access.

Traditional academic culture and evaluation often neither incentivise nor support access-related work, which prioritise the speed of publications over the long, slow work of addressing access-related needs and broader inclusivity. This is a critical, yet often-overlooked aspect of research culture that the Accessibility Working Group has sought to address within The Turing Way community. In developing principles and ways of working, as well as practical guidance for working professionals, they have sought to highlight the current gap between principles and practices.

Similar to anthropologist Susan Leigh Star’s observation that infrastructure is only visible when it breaks, the Accessibility Working Group's contributions become apparent only when accessibility issues arise or are not addressed pre-emptively. Their behind-the-scenes work in ensuring that our existing resources and events meet accessibility standards, as well as writing guidance or implementing necessary changes is often slow, requires moving at the speed of trust on multiple fronts: both within the community as well as within the working group itself, which often involves working across intersectional identities and lived experiences of exclusion from the practices they are working to improve.

Highlighting the work of the Accessibility Working Group within The Turing Way is crucial, as they have shifted the culture of our project and community, and have been integral in stewarding these discussions and resources. Similarly, this submission highlights the need for a broader category of Accessibility within the Hidden REF submission categories, as this topics remains an urgent but overlooked priority for researchers across all institutions everywhere.

## Notes (not used)

**Relevance**:

The work of the Accessibility Working Group is highly relevant in today’s context. With an increasing focus on diversity and inclusion, both within research teams and in the broader scientific community, the group’s efforts to improve accessibility offer a timely and necessary intervention. Their work responds to a critical knowledge gap around how best to ensure that research environments are inclusive of all people, regardless of physical, cognitive, or sensory ability. This contribution not only makes research spaces more inclusive but also enhances the quality and breadth of research outputs by enabling more diverse participation.

**Excellence**:

Although not traditional in form, the group’s contribution exemplifies excellence by influencing both the research lifecycle and community-building efforts. By highlighting accessibility as a core principles of open research, the working group works to ensure that data science is more equitable, and the quality of output is improved through broader participation in the process. The working group supports the development of reproducible workflows that can be implemented widely, ensuring a level of academic rigor in both theory and practice.

By focusing on making research and collaboration environments more accessible to people from diverse backgrounds and abilities, this work transcends traditional academic outputs and emphasizes the importance of responsible and ethical community-building in research.

I am nominating The Turing Way's (TTW) Accessibility Working Group for the "Everything else!" category, nominating Liz Hare as representative of this group for their work in highlight accessibility-related needs and practices in research. 

The Turing Way is an open science and community-led project at The Alan Turing Institute, renowned for its high-quality data science handbook. Co-created by a global community, the handbook includes over 350 chapters across five guides on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration, and Ethical Research, covering topics from sharing code and data to managing reproducible workflows and building diverse teams. 

Over the past 5 years, the project has grown to support multiple initiatives, community-driven working groups, and skill-building activities. The project's governance structure includes three levels: community contributors, self-organised maintainer working groups, and constitutional-level community representations alongside co-leads Malvika Sharan and Kirstie Whitaker as well as a Research Community Manager and Research Project Manager.

The Accessibility Working Group, co-led by Liz Hare, is one of these community-led maintainer groups. In particular, Liz Hare has been integral in shifting how we as a community consider inclusion in research, and what it means to remove barriers for researchers of all types. Building off of previous work with the useR community, Liz hosted a workshop in 2022 at The Turing Way's bi-annual contribution event alongside Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, where she presented accessibility considerations for disability in data science (recording is available online: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARMs7C\_wE04)]([]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARMs7C\_wE04)[]). 

To further explore and address these needs, and how to translate them into concrete policies and practices, the working group was formed in early 2023. This group has been exploring some of the thorniest challenges in both The Turing Way as an open science community and the data science as a whole, working to develop community processes to improve accessibility for contributors in open science who can participate in the development of data science practices despite any barriers that they may face.

This process has The Turing Way Accessibility Working Group draws experts and researchers from both High and Low-to-Middle Income countries, with significant lived- and practical experience as well as commitment to enhancing accessibility in their networks.
