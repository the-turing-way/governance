## Statements from Candidates standing for the Chair role

**Role Description:** Responsible for leading Steering Committee meetings, setting the agenda, ensuring effective decision-making and providing guidance to the rest of the Steering Committee in ensuring strategic development and maintenance of The Turing Way.

**Arielle Bennett:** "I believe in contested elections and that The Turing Way project has a critical 12 months ahead that will transform its future and I want to be doing everything I possibly can to help bring this about, empowering our community, and supporting this committee. If elected I will drive the necessary, thoughtful work of establishing The Turing Way as a fully community-led project, ready to take on the next stage of it's growth. Regardless of which role I am successful in however, I look forward to working with the other positions to achieve our shared goals and aims for the committee and The Turing Way project overall."

**Jim Madge:** "I have been contributing to The Turing Way for around five years, and I'm currently chair of the Infrastructure Working Group.  There, my goals are making our infrastructure more transparent, and using automation to maintain quality and make contribution easier.  I enjoy coordinating people and helping them work together to solve big, shared challenges.  I find a lot of joy in that kind of enabling work.  I'm very passionate about open source.  My vision for The Turing Way is to become a sustainable, community-run project through building open governance, documentation and a strong team of volunteer maintainers."

**Kirstie Whitaker:** "Ever since the founding of The Turing Way our community has met researchers and data practitioners where they are, meeting their needs around reproducibility, open working, and inclusive ways of collaborating. We've been successful in building a strong community with one major institutional funder, and now I'm excited to deliver on our original vision of scaling our efforts to serve even more data and software creators, with multiple institutions supporting the work. My biggest goal as chair would be to empower working groups and individual contributors to see how their skills and expertise - at work and as a volunteer - can be acknowledged and celebrated in The Turing Way and partnerships across the open source ecosystem. I would leverage my position as executive director at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science to deepen The Turing Way's relationships with world leading open source software projects such as JupyterHub, Scientific Python, the MyST ecosystem, the Linux Foundation and a network of open source program offices (CURIOSS and University of California OSPO network), as well as in collaboration with educators serving openly licenced and interactive tutorials."

## Statements from Candidates standing for the Chair-Elect role

**Role Description:** A Chair-Elect supports the Chair in their duties, may take on specific leadership responsibilities as delegated, and acts as Chair in their absence. This role provides an opportunity for shared leadership and continuity as a chair in the following year.

**Batool Almarzouq:** "I joined The Turing Way back in November 2020 as a Book-Dash applicant. Since then, I have co-led our localisation working groups, always with the same goal: to make space for others, to make sure people feel heard, and know they have the power to shape where we go together. I care about keeping all work on the community spaces open, clear, and shared. With this fundamental goal, I will keep pushing for transparency in how we work and how we make decisions in The Turing Way. As a Chair-Elect, I will support the Chair, the committee, and the wider community. The exposure as Chair-Elect will prepare me better to step up in the Chair role in the next year. In my role in Steering Committee, I want to build a space where everyone feels like they belong -- where people understand the process and feel able to challenge it when they need to."

## Statements from Candidates standing for the Secretary role

**Role Description:** Responsible for documenting Steering Committee meetings (minutes), managing communications within the committee, maintaining documentation and ensuring effective information flow between the committee and the community.

**Arielle Bennett:** "I believe The Turing Way has a critical 12 months ahead that will transform its future and I want to be doing everything I possibly can to help bring this about, empowering our community, and supporting this committee. I bring to this role a background of both project management and experience as an elected secretary in other organisations. If elected I will work to ensure consistent meetings and associated logistics, and take the lead on ensuring our discussions are documented in line with our value of transparency. I expect to work closely with the Secretary-elect to ensure systems are properly documented and easy to hand over at the end of the year. However, regardless of which role I am successful in, I look forward to working with the other positions to achieve our shared goals and aims for the committee and The Turing Way project overall."

**Jim Madge:** "I have been contributing to The Turing Way for around five years, and I'm currently chair of the Infrastructure Working Group.  There, my goals are making our infrastructure more transparent, and using automation to maintain quality and make contribution easier.
