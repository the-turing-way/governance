* Discussion of Guiding Principles, based on [https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10/views/1?pane=issue\&itemId=116858503\&issue=the-turing-way%7Cgovernance%7C34](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10/views/1?pane=issue\&itemId=116858503\&issue=the-turing-way%7Cgovernance%7C34)
  * Line 377 in [https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/turing-way-governance-review-august25](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/turing-way-governance-review-august25)
* Documenting governance
  * Ideally, we should have a single source for our governance - the spirit and the rules - which should be easy to find and quick to read
  * There is a risk we have our outputs spread across different parts of the book or multiple repos, which is confusing and would likely lead to different pieces being inconsistent or left out of date.
* Can we review what other resources we have yet to review and if we can discuss a plan for that?

## Notes
* Reviewing decision making process
  * Where do community members open SC items? Discussion or issues
  * Governance repo issues is harder to find than discussions
  * Governance repo may seem exclusive or out of bound for community members
  * I like discussions - it's more explicitly open for the community AND it's in line with what we're nudging the community towards +3
  * Community is moving towards using discussions for anything but issue-like-tasks
* Issues for votes,
  * Works conceptually as there is a task here, SC votes, it is done when there is a decission
  * Could be organised in a project board for convenience
  * Votes in discussions could become difficult to find, amongst other discussions, somewhere in a thread
* Issue template could help make this easier to set up
* **Consensus is:** Use discussions for proposals, discussion, gauging community feelings. When ready for a vote, open a voting issue (in governance repo) 
* Pushing back to maintenance level
  * Is this a vote, or an informal process?
  * Requiring SC to vote every time there is a question whether they need to be involved could generate a lot of work, delays
  * Potentially problems giving SC members the ability to unilaterally push things back to maintenance level. What if there is disagreement?
    * Maybe not such a problem. These decisions are not permanent.
  * This is a bit like issue triage, we trust individuals to do this as representatives of the community
* Are we all able to categorise SC material and maintenance material?
  * Keep focus on empowering community. "We don't ask to be informed so we can manage what you do, but so we can help enable you"
  * Make sure guidance, documentation is clear that we want to empower people. They should feel able to do things and not feel that they must get approval
  * Push people to ask **the community**, not the steering committee
* **Proposal:** Leave the community to decide. If the community cannot agree, this becomes a vote for the SC
* Other documentation
  * Documentation to be systematically reviewed by the Steering Committee: Review plans TBD · Issue #21 · the-turing-way/governance
  * Steering Committee Meeting Agenda for 2025 · Issue #34 · the-turing-way/governance
  * Quite a few documentations, spread across the book and other repos
  * Pressure to push governance information to a single place
* We might want to think about the four types of document and which types are most appropriate for, the community, SC members, [https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)
  * I am appreciating the idea that at a fundamental level - community engagement is the key priority then everything flows from there

## DECISIONS/ACTIONS 
**Decision:** Use discussions for proposals, discussion, gauging community feelings. When ready for a vote, open a voting issue (in governance repo)
**Action:** Add a vote issue template in the governance repo 
**Action:** KW to update PR 
**Decision:** Capture principles, themes, spirit of the governance design and digest this in a good way to present to the community. What does this mean for the community (not rules, policies) but empowerment, community engagement
  * For 2026 - action to promote knowledge of SC for the community. What is SC, what do they do, how to engage
