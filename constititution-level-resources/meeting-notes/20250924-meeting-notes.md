🧊 Icebreaker: What's an inspiring piece of writing or media you've come across recently? 

* Lelle / Turing / I watched last week at Southbank an amazing performance by playright/director Carolina Bianchi (Brazilian, based in Amsterdam) titled 'The Bride and The Goodnight, Cinderella' very raw, very essential, touching on gender-based violence and femicides, highly recommended if you get a chance to catch it anywhere in the world (will be touring in NYC in early October) [https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/the-bride-and-the-goodnight-cinderella/](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/the-bride-and-the-goodnight-cinderella/)
* Sara/ I was just sharing one of my favourite quotes/motto in life in my substack: *You don't make science by following paths- *it still inspires me till this day
* Jim / Maybe "How to with John Wilson", I like that he is strange and makes films about how he sees the world
* Precious/ DSWB/ “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” - Marianne Williamson (This is so long, sorry!)
* Arielle / Turing / Just finished City of Last Chances by Adrian Tchaikovsky, a really compelling look at a political uprising in a fantasy city (it's a little bleak in places but I loved the characters and the GoT style intrigue) 
* Liz, political satire in any form, especially when it reminds me others see things the way I do

## Notes

## Applying to represent The Turing Way, or include it on a grant/fellowship
* Affiliations with the Turing Way for Fellowship applications
  * The Turing Way accepts applications to submit/apply for things in the future as a form of partnership. There are no set rules for the project category to apply for.
  * Develop a "pre code of conduct" to safeguard against bad actors in the future.
  * For example, a fellowship where the fellow does work which is not aligned with the wider community
* Transparency is important. The Community should know that you are making use of the Turing Way in your applications.
* How can these safeguards be applied to fellowship schemes that are not as familiar with TTW as SSI?
* Alternative approach: take a hand's off approach. It is up to the application to make sure their proposal of collaborating with the community is realistic
  * Our current approach is more like this, relying on people to reach out to the community, share ideas and discuss
  * A downside to this is it takes some confidence to put your idea out before the community and take the lead in engaging us
* Documenting how an applicant can get a TTW endorsement is advancing best practices to empower community members to contribute to an open source project
* BUT making it mandatory to need an endorsement, is counterintuitive for the purpose of the project
* Then naturally, in which cases do we require endorsement and when do we not?
  * Sometimes we feel like the community or steering committee SHOULD have a say on endorsing
  * For example, the response to UKRI on data policy
  * The key difference is '*representing*' the Turing Way or contributing to the Turing Way

## Community Forums
* There was confusion about who is responsible for organising community forums
* Previously it was the role of a dedicated community manager
* Many of those responsibilities now sit with the CMWG
* Argument that as a strategically important event, the steering committee should take responsibility
* Some history
  * A special arrangement was made for the June 2025 community forum
  * CMWG set the date for the September 2025 community forum, but did not assume responsibility for the event
* CMWG
  * Feeling overwhelmed by project maintenance (GitHub)
  * Fluctuation in capacity
  * Great effort from members, but this is volunteer effort
  * Clashes with tasks that cannot be delegated (for example, running events, sending newsletters)
  * Difficult to call on people/assign tasks when people are volunteering
  * Onboarding more members
  * Hopeful that better documentation will help
  * Risk of CMWG burn out!
* Discussion on options going forward 
* We [CMWG] have tried to keep all existing activities going, with only volunteer effort. The project should be open to changing things to reduce stress on CMWG and make things sustainable for volunteers. For example,
  * Less regular newsletters/updates
  * Simplify social media (or suspend)
* CMWG should assess what are the most important things, or essential activities to maintain, what can scale with capacity, what are nice-to-haves
* **Proposal:** make the steering committee responsible, accountability is held by the chair
  * No objections  🎉
* Steering committee will take ownership of community forums
  * An opportunity for the governance level to do something to celebrate the contributions of all community members
  * The purpose of the community forum is to engage contributions across all of the community
  * That feels well within the remit of the governance level

## Actions & Decisions
**Decision**: Decision on how long is the term for chair (and deputy) and secretary (and deputy).
   * The decision was for 1 year, but do we need to be more specific whether this refers to 12 months from election or calendar year? 
   * Consensus on 12 months from election date
**ACTION:** Make sure this agrerement is included in writing up of steering committee roles
**Decision**: Confirmed that Steering Committee will take ownership of Community Forums 
**ACTION:** Update Community Handbook page on Community Forums to reflect updated decisions the-turing-way/book/website/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-forums.md
