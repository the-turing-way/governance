* Discussion of Guiding Principles, based on https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=116858503&issue=the-turing-way%7Cgovernance%7C34
  * Line 377 in https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/turing-way-governance-review-august25
## Notes
* Guiding principles
  * Are the three principles the correct ones? Are any missing?
  * Feeling that the principles reflect the community and our values.
  * Three principles, but there are five explanatory sections, why is that?
    * Historical, these were first written (perhaps) before SC created, may refer to legacy things
    * In particular, might have a strong focus on working groups, whereas we might want these to be more universally applied across the community.
      * E.g. empowerment of community, trying to structure decision making community > maintenance > governance
* We need to redraft these to reflect the current state
  * Focus on governance structure
  * Focus on empowering community
* Jim: It is quite wordy and long. Examples are good but maybe that can be a separate document. 
  * And, to detangle the principles themselves from how they are applied in practice for, working groups, SC, and so on
* Guiding principles at governance level or decision making? 
  * Remove "decision making", make clear that these principles are for the whole project, everyone in the community
* New structure
  * Principles
    * Principle - one sentence explanation
* Detail
  * Principle - one/two paragraphs
  * Bibliography/further reading
* Application to:
  * Working groups
    * Principle - few sentences to say how the principle applies. Include examples where useful
  * Steering committee
* and so on
* Went on to redraft in the framapad document

## Actions & Decisions 
* ACTION: Precious to "tidy up" the edits and share with Steering Committee for broad review and approval
