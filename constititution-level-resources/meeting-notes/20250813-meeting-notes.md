## Agenda / Notes
- Any other reflections on our first async vote? (context: https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4316)
  - Showed that there does need to be some process - helpful to be able to make a decision and be clear about who and what needed to ask permission
  - Demonstrated that we worked well together and wanted to make a decision clearly
  - Although, Arielle did take on the leading role here
  - Feels appropriate that the steering committee should have input (or control) on what gets presented as the "community's opinion".
  - This was perhaps an easy test case:
    - Richard is well known in the community
    - We had enough time to read the response and have a conversation (it was more rushed than ideal, but still sufficient)
    - The response was developed in the open, at collaboration cafés (and on GitHub?)
    - Are we an "approver" or a "gatekeeper"
    - Community input happened _before_ the specific permission so this feels more like approver
  - What does this tell us as an example of where permission/authority sits?
  - **Our aim is for the Steering Committee to make as few decisions as possible, and to pass decisions back to the maintenance level**
  - **Is there a risk that this is moving towards asking all questions to Steering Committee?**
  - Which working group could be responsible for this?
    - Community Management Working Group seems like a good fit, however they may not have been prepared for this at the time, and they already have a lot of responsibility
    - If no existing Working Group, then a "policy" Working Group? 
- A risk that we are creating bureaucracy we don't want here
- Taking the voting comment we used as an example: https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4316#discussioncomment-13937186
    - This was quite a simple, public system
    - There is only one vote, which can be the same for all decisions
- We need a chapter in the TTW with examples about past policy responses that was submitted in the past on behalf of the TTW along with intsructions on how they can lead similar examples.
  - Arielle's Questions:
    - How long for voting?
      - 24 hours felt too short
      - 7 consecutive days - could be a good target
      - **DECISION** Agreed on starting with 7 days, and reviewing how this works
      - We can avoid strain on voting, by making proposals (upcoming votes) visible and active, with community involvement, in advance of any vote.
  - What are cases where a vote would be needed on short notice?
  - Proposals should suggest a deadline, when they need a decision by in order to take action. This deadline should (or must?) be longer than the voting period.
  - Do the voting options feel right?
    - Tested options were "yes", "no", "need more information", "abstain - with reason"
    - **DECISION** Agreed that these work, with the guidlines that we always aim for a yes or no, and use the other options in more exceptional circumstances
        - Arielle did exceptional work ➕
  - Need to make sure we understand quorum and how different vote outcomes are achieved. For example:
    - Can a chair tie break?
    - Can "need more information" votes make a vote null and force a resubmission?
    - In a previous meeting we agreed on simple majority (5/8)
    - **ACTION:** Should document this (in our voting template?)
    - Anything except "yes" counts as "no"
    - Can you change your vote before the deadline?
      - Changing from confused to yes or no feels likely (and very useful!)
      - Changing from yes to confused could happen (but would be a bit irritating)
    - A general rule could be:
      - If you aren't certain, put confused in early and look to change to yes or no
      - If you are certain, put yes or no in early and avoid changing unless something significant happens
- **ReSA nomination - Sara Villa is planning to nominate herself by 5th September**
  - Arielle note - unclear what discussion was had on this topic or if any decisions were made, will update with more details  
- **Discussion: What is a delivery group? https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/turing-way-governance-review-june25 - File 2, line 97**
  - Delivery groups have external accountability, as well as accountability to The Turing Way community
  - Not as open
  - Not anyone can join (stakeholders might want to keep the groups small, trusted)
  - Some outputs or work might not be open (but we keep our open as possible principle)
  - A way to support people being paid to work on The Turing Way
  - Delivery group (DG) chairs would have seats on the Steering Committee
    - Are we happy with this?
    - Risk of buying influence?
    - Current DG chairs: Kirstie, Malvika, Arielle
    - As these people are paid to contribute to The Turing Way, they may find it easier to find time to contribute to Steering Committee business
    - Seats mean DGs have representation on the Steering Committee
  - Concerns
    - The objectives of a DG and community governance feel quite orthogonal. Perhaps we don't want DG chairs on the steering committee, perhaps they wouldn't have much input on governance decisions
    - Could DGs be individuals with funding, working on The Turing Way - probably not - having funding and contributing to The Turing Way is not the same as forming a DG.
    - A DG should be looking to do work through improving The Turing Way, they should be invested in contributing to The Turing Way
  - DGs and CGs can feels quite different. DGs likely have quite a narrow focus, and strong incentive to meet their objectives.
    - Arielle note: not sure what "CG" means here, if it's community governance then that needs stating, will investigate
  - CGs likely represent a larger portion of the community with common interests and have incentives to work "for the community"
  - Could see DGs as funded teams working on particular deliverables which come under the remit of a WG
  - In these cases, it makes less sense for both the DG and WG to have seats on the Steering Committee
  - Could decide this based on where the accountability lies. For example, is a DG accountable to a WG, or to the whole community/constitutional level.
  - For example, if a DG was working on a deliverable which is clearly for one WG, it may make sense to not give that DG a chair
- Getting into a conversation about what "deserves" a chair on the Steering Committee
- Rules, creating a new DG requires:
  - Community input (benefit to the community of the DGs work)
  - Approval from the Steering Committee
  - Proposal
- Don't create new DGs, recognise how the existing DGs came from a time before our new governance (???)
- Find a way to handle Book Dash planning committee, which feels like a DG accountable to the Book Dash WG
- In some sense, DGs could be more accountable to The Turing Way community, because we are expecting specific deliverable from them.
- This is different to WGs which we imagine are (almost) entirely volunteers, who we cannot compell to work.
