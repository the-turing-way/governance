## Notes 23-04-2025

* Steering Committee roles
  * EK - treasurer should be in to track different pots of money (possibly different funding bodies)
  * KW - working group focused on looking at the finances, chair of the working group joined the Steering Committee (participatory across the whole of the project / rather than rotating responsibility for one person)
  * There are other budgets/expenses, for example hosting, domain registration, events, Slack, zoom. Is this the responsibility of a treasurer.
  * Should this be a WG chair, or a distinct committee role with delegated power?
  * AB: there is scope for funding WG chair to coordinate with SC
  * People who apply for funding for particular project bits could use support from FA WG to adhere to funding restrictions, overheads, academic peculiarities,
  * EK: Who can we imagine joining the group, except for us? Do we have capacity for creating a new working group? The people who think most about funding The Turing Way are already in this group
  * LD: diversified funding with different pots is different financial management vs a single large pot that needs administering
  * AB: the advantage of specific WG is that other community members can feel empowered to apply for funding (even if there is overlap with SC) - could membership be more fluid (more opportunity-specific?)
  * LH: I've been wondering how the task of finding and applying for funding fits into the whole structure. Is that he same as as a treasurer or different?
  * LH: Great point that a working group could facilitate people applying with us. It's an opportunity to clarify how applying with TTW works
  * JM: we need to disambiguate between funding applications and financial administration
  * KW: Worth revisiting this discussion when the rest of the SC is present. The purpose of this group is not to cover all the tasks previously covered by employed staff (formerly from the Turing). Currently the funding falls within the delivery groups (and the budget can be managed within the delivery group). E.g netlify budget under Infrastructure group or an institution gives us £1000 and we need to tell them how is this money allocated. It's a totally different responsibility from fundraising. Our participation in this committee is to represent our WGs/DGs. 
  * JM: I really like this idea. Giving more control/power to the mid level which more people can get involved with 🎉
  * KW: committee needs a chair and secretary

## ACTIONS

* ACTION: AB to open an issue on funding acquisitions working group
* ACTION: identify a returning officer for the election 
* Action for all: review and comment on Malvika's PR: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/pull/23](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/pull/23)
   * Governance documentation: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/issues/21](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/issues/21)

* Other Turing Way Priorities
  * Documentation - want to spend a full session on this
  * WG priorities and ways to gather those 
  * Listening sessions: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4137](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4137)
  * Collab cafe - second hour 
  * JM: how do we use infrastructure to capture ideas and track escalation/evolution? 
  * KW:IDEALLY: the SC ultimately gets to a point where individual contributors are as empowered as possible, WG/DGs can make decisions on things that are in their sphere of influence, SC only adjudicates on decisions that WG/DGs can't make on their own 
    * For example, moving our repositories to a Turing Way organisation from the Turing Institute organisation. Too big an action/decision for an individual contributor to make. Also, too big for a working group to make. However, working groups may have an opinion on why or why not this should be done. In this case, the infra WG made a case which was pushed up for a decision.
    * This way community members are empowered in the process, making proposals and sharing thoughts, through working groups, and the steering committee can make decisions
