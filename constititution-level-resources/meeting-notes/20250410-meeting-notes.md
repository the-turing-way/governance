## Introducing Steering Committee Members

* Prompt for discussion
   * Share an example from any project (work or non-work) where decision-making feels collaborative, inclusive and joyful.
   * Can you reflect on what makes it so special?
   * Is there a way to bring it in our work here?

* Notes:
   * KW: Berkeley Institute of Data Science - revolutionising publishing
       * Scientific Python: [https://scientific-python.org](https://scientific-python.org)
       * JupyterHub: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/jupyterhub-orgmyc-EOSS](https://github.com/the-turing-way/jupyterhub-orgmyc-EOSS)
   * LD: AI in Arts Interest Group: interdisciplinarity, regular meet up, knowledge share, things we personally care about are discussed
   * EK: AIM-RSF has been lovely to work in - collaborative and reflective: Celebration, archiving
   * ABL: Union organising: Branch meetings and any member can submit a motion, views of the union and actions they want to discuss, lively debate - great way to make decision (clear guideline)
       * Not always joyful, sometimes its incredibly painful - but having guideline and timelines for what and how to engage give people lots of freedom and agency!
   * JM: People with social authority or power making decision works well especially in trustworthy space (caring about the right thing) - when people care about the same thing and have shared understanding for "this is important" -- making decision in favor of right is easier and results into stronger connection and shared experience.
   * LH: Opportunities for talking through decision and leaning into each other (trusting relation) 
   * ALS: Editorial: Governance building, structure and documentation. Be part of something you are part of that grows beyond you! Experimentation and joy in the core, rituals. FOSDEM: Informal decision + formal processes for others + Time bound, small commitment
   * BA: I was reminiscing about my first SSI Collaborations Workshop from 2â€“3 years ago. It was held online, but it had such a unique vibeâ€”honestly, it didnâ€™t *feel* like an online event. The energy was v. different; it had a kind of magic to it. The thing I found interesting is that although called the "Software" Sustainability Institute, but I was struck by how welcoming it was to non-technical folks. I will be joining this year, so looking forward to joining again this year!
 
## Agenda

* Navigate what resources we will use to manage the steering committee:
  * GitHub repo: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/](https://github.com/the-turing-way/governance/)
  * Do we need a private repo in addition to this repo?
  * Project board: [https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10)
    * (Org level - not in the governance repo)
  * Slack channel - set up by the project team
    * Private for Steering Committee
  * Calendar for governance? Or a direct invite?
    * Direct invites AND governance calendar!
  * Google Drive folder
   * What else is needed to support participation?

### Notes

* ~~Email list suggestion: Google mailing list?~~
  * KW - Berkeley can "sponsor" a mailing list if that's useful - we can chat offline
  * Or alteratively SSI can support (better!)
* Zoom account
  * SSI or OLS
  * Alternative Jitsi - open source tool - doesn't work well with too many people, but we are small enough group
* Do we need private space
  * Slack
  * GitHub - Maybe
  * Where do we review docs - TBD
  * A private repo would be good to monitor private tasks, as well as private documents (for review before publication)
      * There is also the private slack channel and googledocs (but they are not very accessible)
* Framapad folder/group is also an option - MS tested and its clunky
* Calendar
  * Invitation + subscribable
* Representation in Steering Committee
  * 1 person each group
* Nomination for roles:
  * Chair
  * Secretary
  * Treasurer?
  * Nomination process for these roles need to be discussed
  * After nomination period, votes for the nominees in each role
    * Voting rules
    * Ballot type
      * N votes for each voter for each role?
      * Ranked voting (ordinal ballot)
      * Rated voting
      * ...
* A valid ballot requires at least x% of the voting body casting?
  * Greatest number of votes wins? Requires some proportion of votes?
  * In case of one person winning two roles... ?
  * Proposal for ranked choice voting, in the case of someone winning 2 roles then the person who comes second in one is offered it (unless they've come top in another role) and so on down the list
