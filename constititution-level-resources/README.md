# Constitution Level Resources

All resources related to the Constitution Level, such as those associated with the Steering Committee's work, will be listed below.

## Project Management

We will use the [GitHub Project Board 10](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/projects/10) to centralise, coordinate and manage all constitution-level matters.

The Project Delivery Team will be supporting the formalisation and operationalisation of the Steering Committee between April to June 2025.
For any information, please contact them by emailing [theturingway@gmail.com].
