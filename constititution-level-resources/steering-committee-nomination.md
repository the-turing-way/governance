# Title: *The Turing Way* Steering Committee Role Nomination and Your Participation

## Form Description

In this form, the Project Delivery Team invites *The Turing Way* Steering Committee members ([membership list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-hF8xtVHA7kp_AuRTaT3AgY8xqyYXFPOt2UO7Hb8ntk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)) to indicate preferences/nominations for themselves and others for the roles of Chair, Chair-Elect, Secretary and Secretary-Elect.
This will help structure and support the ongoing development of Constitution-Level Governance in *The Turing Way*.

While the more detailed version of roles and responsibilities will be reviewed and finalised with the committee in the coming weeks, here is a brief description of these roles for your reference: 

* **Chair:** Responsible for leading Steering Committee meetings, setting the agenda, ensuring effective decision-making and providing guidance to the rest of the Steering Committee in ensuring strategic development and maintenance of *The Turing Way*.
* **Chair-Elect:** A Chair-Elect supports the Chair in their duties, may take on specific leadership responsibilities as delegated, and acts as Chair in their absence. This role provides an opportunity for shared leadership and continuity as a chair in the following year.
* **Secretary:** Responsible for documenting Steering Committee meetings (minutes), managing communications within the committee, maintaining documentation and ensuring effective information flow between the committee and the community.
* **Secretary-Elect:** A Secretary-Elect supports the Secretary in their duties, may take on specific responsibilities as delegated, and acts as Secretary in their absence. This role provides an opportunity for shared leadership and continuity as a Secretary in the following year.
