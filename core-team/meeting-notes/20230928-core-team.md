#### The Turing Way Governance Exercise: "Three Level of Decision Making" (45 min)

[Kirstie] Present "Three Level of Decision Making" - Using the following Miro Board: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/?share\_link\_id=448367996190](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/?share\_link\_id=448367996190)  (5 min)

   * Part 1: Individual silent reflection on the Miro board (10 min - 2 x 5min): What kind of decisions should each level take? Reflections to be added directly on miro board (view only link: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/?share\_link\_id=448367996190)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMnA6G50=/?share\_link\_id=448367996190))

   * Part 2: Select a level and together discuss and select which decisions, or type of decisions, this level should take (10 min):


**Constitutional Level group: Take notes here which will be added to Miro board. If you can, please add your comments directly to Frame 7 - Miro board (Alden, Andrea, Bastian and Esther)**

   * Fran: Changes to the governance structure of TTW
   * Fran: Changes and voting to core team
   * SHould provide workflows about how decisions are made, they're not made there but how they are made. Those should be taking by the maintianier level: there should be a wg for funding. 
  
   * Notes from Esther: Constitutional level needs to decide how decisions are made, what are workflows?, so not all the decisions are made at the constituitonal level and can be made at the maintainer/community level.
   * For example: Constitutional level should provide the criteria to add a new book, should belong to a working group.
   * There should be a working group for funding (but how much funding is available is constitutional)
   * Who creates a workinggroup and what is a working group is constituional. 
   * Constitutional level should decide about accountability of working groups
   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 



   * **Maintainer Level group: Take notes here which will be added to Miro board. If you can, please add your comments directly to Frame 6 - Miro board (Batool, Danny, Eirini, Liz, Melissa, Sarah, Vicky)**
   * Making grants, there's experience  and it might be worth to have a policy to write grants for TTW
   * WG: who governs, who creates a wg, who is accountable for a wg
   * WG: events / bookdash
   * WG: another for automatisation, 
   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 

   * 



** Operational Level group: Take notes here which will be added to Miro board. If you can, please add your comments directly to Frame 5 - Miro board (Alejandro, Arielle, David, Fran, Jen, Jim, Sydney)**

   * Kick off questions: what operational level means - who does it include? Why can't the community just make all the decisions? 
       * If you want all community to make decisions, it still requires certain governance. 
   * Another way I think about is the maintainers are responsible for doing the work to create the structures/resources/meetings that make it easier for community members to contribute meaningfully in the time they have
   * Structure can empower people to contribute, shouldn't be a barrier  - Make sure we provide guidance to contribute
   * Rename Operational Level as it's associated to expenses, managing, etc. 
   * Agree with Fran’s point that would be helpful to have a list of activities so the community is aware of what they can be part of
   * 

   * Keep us much as possible at this level, as this is the largest group
   * 

   * 



   * Part 3: Group Discussion (30 min) - What is the general feeling about using this framework for *The Turing Way*?


   * Theres a few around working groups that I think sit between levels - specifically because the leadership is likely to issue guidance for the working groups but it's up to the working groups to organise in alignment with that guidance?
   * Some of the previous notes on decisions focus on funding and representation at conferences - Alden is writing up some decisions around this for the miro board 
   * Danny: maintainer level, CoC enforcement - if I think myself as a maintainer that shouldn't be in my place. 
       * Kirstie: responsiblities within the WG are independent. the model is thinking of taking certain aspects of responsibilities. There will be CoC WG that enforces the CoC, where it sits, that is the question
   * EK: Pathway of the people within TTW \& the balance in this particular areas, specifically talking about the working groups
       * KW: Pathways, in her head it was important to identify the which decisions we have to take and then think about pathway. Yes, how we move people throught the levels. How do we keep people where they feel more excited about is def very important. 
           * The core team is not probably going to exist when we start this structure as they will be part of WG - there is a core people who work for TTW paid for it and we fit into different roles, MS / KW, leadership and ALS/ AAA as secretariat of WG and overal support to the project
   * DG: I think one thing that would be a (surmountable) challenge about having CoC enforcement as a working group is that it would require certain responsiveness commitments, which I associate with paid members of staff (though maybe that just holds a mirror up to some things I've learnt about the capitalistic way of the world which maybe I should be trying to unlearn haha)
   * AB: Who is in the WG - that should be in the Operational level as nobody should be excluded from joining a working groups ---> highligh it in the pathways of how to join WG, how they are accountable for the maintainer level
       * KW: The Consitituional level could decide if a new GG should be created but motivated by the Operational level---> push by them, pathway to make that happen
   * BG: Difference between who make decisions but how we make decision. We should think about how to disentagle this for a moment. This distintion is confusing
   * BS: i guess what i’m trying to say is “the constitution” decides like “our executive will be run by electing a president/prime minister/etc:” But: the person that is elected in that role doesn’t get to change the constitution, so that person isn’t “on the constitutional level”, does that help at all?
   * JM: the arrows going between different level, are pathways?  Or is that the flow of ideas or influence? The sources of action, how do we expect it to work. A structure 1. you expect / 2. if you're in a WG one of your responisbilities is go back to community and check what they need. 
       * Who supports the accountability and in which direction 
   * LH: and what are the leaders' responsibilities?
       * KW: that's fitting into what Bastian is saying, we're not creating TTW from scratch. We could write a dominance model but it would be unrealistic as it would be quite unralistic of who would become a leader / funding is associated to both leaders and are related to her job. Probalby makes sense as this model as a model that works for a couple years (2) and then it will be reviewed. 
       * DG: That's the first time I'm hearing that, and I think that's useful context/framing
   * Batool: It’s tricky to figure out which decision fits where - unless we pinpoint who the Working Groups (WG) are and see how they’re interacting with both the “operational/community” folks and the “constitutional/leads” in making these decisions. They’re all intertwined - not independent.
   * AB: For transparency there's a few decisions in the "maintainers" section I actually feel should be sitting in the operational/community level, particularly when it comes to content. We need to define who is in each working group and how they work and how they interact in both directions. 
       * i think that’s quite similar to my point about it not being necessarily about people, but process
       * KW: kind of disagree, as the coherence of the whole project could be taken care of. Maintainer the style and improving it is higher up
   * Sarah: A RACI diagram with WGs, leaders, and community members might be a useful way to visualise interactions?
   * AC: Add and Ad-hoc working group  
       * KW: something similar to the CoC WG a different level of commitment to know if they
