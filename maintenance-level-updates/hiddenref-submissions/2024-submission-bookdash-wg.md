## Summary

**In up to 300 words, please describe your submission to this category and the reasons how it (or the person you have nominated) have contributed to the success of research.**


This nomination is for the Book Dash Working Group, composed of Arielle Bennett, Esther Plomp, Emma Karoune, Carlos Martinez-Ortiz, Susana Roman-Garcia, and Alexandra Araujo Alvarez. The working group, comprised of volunteers that organise and facilitate the project’s bi-annual Book Dash event has been essential in fostering collaboration, community-building, and the continued creation of high-quality, open access resources for widespread use by researchers and scientists.

The Turing Way is a large open science and community-led project at The Alan Turing Institute, widely known and renowned for its high-quality data science handbook. Co-created by a global community, the handbook includes over 350 chapters across five guides on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration, and Ethical Research. With over 500 contributors from various backgrounds, identities and lived experiences, the project has expanded greatly in its past five years of growth. Web analytics show monthly engagement with 7,000 users, 17,000 page views, 35,000 resource downloads (from Zenodo), and 100+ citations to date. Readers and users span multiple countries, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the USA, Venezuela, and beyond. 

Book Dashes are integral for this global community, as events where participants collaboratively work on The Turing Way guides to develop new chapters, review or edit existing work, maintain resources, or work on other subprojects. A cornerstone of the project, 11 Book Dashes have been hosted both online and in-person over the past five years of the project’s growth and development.

As the community and project has grown, Book Dashes have become increasingly important in stewarding diverse contributions. The Book Dash Working Group, which decides the strategic direction of the event has demonstrated leadership in maintaining both the quality and inclusiveness of the event.

The Book Dash Working Group is composed of long-time volunteer leaders of *The Turing Way *community. They play a crucial role in organising and sustaining the Book Dash event, and have been instrumental in maintaining the event’s inclusivity and effectiveness, ensuring that both new and experienced contributors have a meaningful and enjoyable experience.

Local Importance: 

The Book Dash Working Group has been pivotal in organising hybrid events that accommodate participants from a wide range of geographies and backgrounds. From the start, Book Dash events have been organised as hybrid events with participants joining from at least 6 different time zones, as well as  in-person hubs outside of London, UK where the project team is based. 

The Book Dash Working Group has been integral in ensuring the development of local hubs, previously organised in Delft and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, as well as Bristol, UK. In order to accommodate and support contributors across different geographies, remote working sessions are also organised for Americas and Asia-Pacific time zones. This ensures that the widest number of participants can join and contribute to the project, reducing barriers to global cooperation.

Leadership

The Book Dash event remains a focal contribution event for The Turing Way community. The Working Group’s role in steering and managing this key event highlights their significant contribution to the project’s continued growth and community cohesion.

Reflexive and Positionality

As experienced contributors to The Turing Way community and Book Dash events, the Book Dash Working Group has a strong understanding of the project’s culture and community. The working group regularly reflects on the inclusivity, accessibility, and engagement of the week-long event based on participant feedback, and how it can better reach and engage with the global community that contributes to the resource.

**Please describe how/why this submission is overlooked/hidden within current research culture and evaluation approaches. ***

Ensuring the strategic direction and continuity of *The Turing Way *Book Dash event is crucial, yet the contributions of the Book Dash Working Group are often overlooked. Similar to any organising committee or for any ongoing event, their essential role is frequently underestimated within current research culture and evaluation frameworks, which focus on research ouputs rather than service efforts. In addition, since much of the Working Group members time is spent supporting and mentoring others to contribute 

In supporting a culture of collaboration rather than individual outputs, the work of the group  involves developing systems and convening capacity that ensure community health and growth of the project. This involves planning training workshops, onboarding sessions, networking events, and carrying out other crucial activities, including integrating new contributors to the project. As a result, the impact of this work is often cumulative and ongoing, rather than tied to a single, easily measurable output.  

Their work exemplifies the invisible labour that sustains many other open source and collaboration research communities, often hidden from traditional evaluation metrics. This type of invisible labour is vital for sustaining The Turing Way community, and enhancing the collective infrastructure of the project.
