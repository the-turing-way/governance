## Summary

**In up to 300 words, please describe your submission to this category and the reasons how it (or the person you have nominated) have contributed to the success of research.**


This submission is to collectively nominate the co-leads of the Infrastructure Working Group, consisting of Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside, Brigitta Sipőcz, and Jim Madge, for their crucial contributions as volunteer open-source maintainers to The Turing Way project. They have played a fundamental role in supporting and maintaining *The Turing Way*, an open-source project that promotes best practices in reproducible, ethical, and inclusive data science. 

The Turing Way is a large open science and community-led project at The Alan Turing Institute, widely known and renowned for its high-quality data science handbook. Co-created by a global community, the handbook includes over 350 chapters across five guides on Reproducible Research, Project Design, Communication, Collaboration, and Ethical Research. With over 500 contributors from various backgrounds, identities and lived experiences, the project has expanded greatly in its past five years of growth. Web analytics show monthly engagement with 7,000 users, 17,000 page views, 35,000 resource downloads (from Zenodo), and 100+ citations to date. Readers and users span multiple countries, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the USA, Venezuela, and beyond. In many ways, The Turing Way itself has become research infrastructure for teams and research labs across the world.

Maintaining and developing this resource has required developing the infrastructure – both human and technical – to support it. The Infrastructure Working Group’s expertise has been instrumental in scaling The Turing Way to meet the needs of its growing community while maintaining the project’s usability and functionality. 

Composed of experienced and long-term contributors to the project, the team stewarded our move from a single Github repository to a broader organisation, liasoning across sub-communities and teams within the project to ease this transition. They also work to maintain the project’s website, collaborating with other working groups to support their work, automating workflows, and ensuring that contributions from our diverse global community are smoothly integrated. Their support ensures that all contributors, from early-career researchers to senior academics, can meaningfully engage with the project, enabling it to remain a vital component of the global research landscape.

By maintaining the backbone of the project, the Infrastructure Working Group has contributed to the advancement of research worldwide, ensuring that best practices in data science continue to be widely shared and implemented through The Turing Way project. Their voluntary, often unrecognised contributions have been critical to the success and sustainability of this impactful research infrastructure, used by many other researchers.

The Infrastructure Working Group of The Turing Way – composed of Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside, Brigitta Sipocz, and Jim Madge – demonstrates significant impact on the global research community by maintaining and developing the infrastructure of one of the most widely-used open-source projects in data science.

**Leadership:**

The group has gone beyond what is typically expected of their roles. They have taken on the challenge of managing a complex, evolving infrastructure in a voluntary capacity, contributing significantly to the development of new features and improving user experience. Their leadership in creating robust, scalable infrastructure has set a standard for other open-source projects and has empowered contributors to actively participate in the project. 

Furthermore, the team has contributed significantly to the wider notion of maintenance as a core value of The Turing Way community, leading . Shared by working group leads at the FOSS Backstage and FOSDEM conferences in Berlin and Brussels, the Infrastructure Working Group team has. 

**Responsibility:**

The Infrastructure Working Group embodies a deep sense of responsibility to the global research community. Their work ensures that The Turing Way infrastructure remains accessible, functional, and responsive to the needs of users from diverse backgrounds. They are committed to maintaining the project’s core principles of openness, collaboration, and inclusivity, which are crucial to its role as a global resource.

The contributions of the Infrastructure Working Group in The Turing Way are often overlooked in current research culture because research infrastructure, much like other forms of infrastructure, is only noticed when it fails or breaks. The contributions of Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside, Brigitta Sipocz, and Jim Madge embody this hidden role. Their maintenance of the project’s infrastructure – ensuring smooth collaboration across our global network of contributors, automating workflows, as well as managing technical complexities has been crucial to the success of the project, yet is seldom acknowledged as a critical research activity. Their role is akin to Nadia Eghbal’s concept of open source maintainers as "digital public infrastructure builders," whose contributions are essential but often go unnoticed in traditional evaluation systems that focus on visible outputs like publications or datasets.

Current research evaluation approaches typically prioritise visible academic outputs such as peer-reviewed papers, over the essential, yet invisible work that supports them. The Infrastructure Working Group's contributions are fundamental to The Turing Way’s continued impact, yet this critical technical work is not traditionally rewarded or even visible within academic metrics.

By maintaining an open-source infrastructure that facilitates global collaboration and knowledge-sharing, this team has provided the essential foundation for The Turing Way’s success. However, the invisibility of this work within traditional research evaluation frameworks means that their role remains hidden, despite its profound impact on the project and the wider research community.
