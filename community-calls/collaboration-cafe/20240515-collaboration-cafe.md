Please add a 🤫 emoji next to any line that you would not like to be included in the archive on Github

* Quiet Working room.
* Localisation Room: Batool + Alycia
* Infrastructure WG: Playing with translations on readthedocs
    * The path forwards with readthedocs we'd imaged is a no-go because one version of repo - so we'd need to do a multi-repo approach
    * Need to co-ordinate with localisation team
    * Not technical issue, just organizational
        * Though we might run into limit of how many RTD projects we're allowed (for free)
    * To avoid duplicating images we should/could spin those out into separate repo
        * Could we link direct to zenodo?
    * If not readthedocs, self-hosting:
        * We'd need css to create language dropdown
        * Where are we hosting (£?)
        * Then it would be a matrix/CI job
    * Problems we've faced with RTD
    * Would need multiple config files - that requires specifying non-standard config paths, which is listed as "experimental"
    * Once you've imported a repo once you can't import it again (to create another language from within the same repo)
* RAM room: Turing Way + RAM paper links
* Environmental Sustainability
* Fireside chat
* Educators room
* Individuals
    * RCM-RAM doc
* Book dash hackathon study
