* Anne + she/her + I think one of the most meaningful lessons from the past year is that open does not necessarily mean accessible, and that there's so much translation and codeswitching required to make us understandable to each other across silos, perspectives, life experiences, and disciplines (and so much that remains invisible!) - in the open source world and otherwise!
* L√©ll√© + she/her + Joining the Turing Way community and making my first commit during BookDash ! :tada: 
* Malvika + She/her + Open source can be very messy - people have opinions that are strongly tied to their identities and feelings. But it is not the entire of open source - there are many beautiful corners that I have found kind and inspiring. I am proud that I now don't mind this nuance!? (this sounds more like a rant!)
* Jim + he/him + Sometimes, there will be users you don't know about, and sometimes, they will contribute to your project. This year was the first time someone I didn't know opened a PR to something I work on.
* Arielle + she/her + My lesson - deliberate thought about pathways, community design, and governance may not always show immediate results but it pays off in the long run. It's worth putting the work in to it.  
* Alejandro + he/him + Open-source won't exist without the power of the surroundings communities 
* Precious + she/her + allyship! + üò∫
* Liz she/her, frazzled with tech today y would be my emoji, I've learned that it's valuable to work with folks who are intentional about they work together.r and how we interact
* Brigitta + she/her + I finally managed to meet in person with a lot of people I work with remotely, both for my day job and for the TTW. And I try to cultivate prior lessons I had, like valuing the teams that have kind people and avoid the ones with toxic member.
* Sara + she/her + I can contribute to Open Science 'stuff' more than I thought, and it makes me SO HAPPY üêº
* Beth + she/her + I'm a big fan of the way that open conversations and reports can pull together so many ideas, comments, thoughts and ways of thinking about topics.
