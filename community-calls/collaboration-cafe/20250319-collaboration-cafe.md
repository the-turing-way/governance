## Breakout rooms: Topic proposals and notesâœ¨ 

While no sign-ups are required to attend Collaboration Cafe, if you have an idea for a topic you'd like to discuss in a breakout room, please add it below and put your name next to it. 

If you like one of the topics that are already suggested, please add your name next to that one. For more information about breakout rooms see the description on GitHub [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project\_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md#breakout-rooms)](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/project\_management/online-collaboration-cafe.md#breakout-rooms)).

*  Esther: SSI project on how to support contributions to the Turing Way, focusing on a distinction between volunteer/paid contributions! See GitHub issue: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3833](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3833) and Ethical materials ([https://hackmd.io/BLUnM20cS1iv5-JiL7-k9g)](https://hackmd.io/BLUnM20cS1iv5-JiL7-k9g)) that will form the base of the discussion today, as well as the questions for the survey and the interviews below!

## SSI Project Discussion Notes

This study/project is intended to:

* Identify successes, challenges and opportunities that contributors face when they contribute to The Turing Way
* Identify what paid contributions look like (financial compensation, training, mentoring, visibility, time?)
* Support both paid and volunteer contributions to the community, developing strategies to avoid differentiation between these types of contributions
* Inform the revision and improvement of the contribution processes, ensuring that contributors receive fitting compensation and acknowledgement.


## Draft Survey Questions

**Please suggest any names of other Turing Way community members that could contribute to the project**

## 

* Can you tell us more about how you plan to share the results?
* And also, you're asking people to share potentially sensitive views around these topics - how are you approaching those considerations?
* How will the results feedback into the community? 
    * Working group to address and implement the results
    * Turing Way chapters on acknowledging and compensating contributors 
* Advising other projects or just the Turing Way? Feels like a lot of work if it's both? 
* Will be specifically focused on TTW. Planning to interview 15-25ish. 
* Advising the Turing Way is the first step of many other steps?
* How will you address the previous versions of the TTW community? Or the future iterations of what that may look like in 2025?
* Do you interview people that have left the project? (tied to questions that were asked about the JupyterHub project)
* What's better - a registered report OR a pilot of the instruments themselves? People on the fence about what might be valuable
    * Who is the beneficiary of each tool being used?
    * 

* Using a combination of surveys and interviews - semi-structured (audio recorded and transcribed)
* Consent will be asked about publishing transcripts.
* There will be an issue updated so people can be informed about the steps of the project?
* What's the most likely bad thing that could happen as a result of this research?
* Doing
* google forms alternative
    * [https://cryptpad.fr/](https://cryptpad.fr/)
    * [https://liberaforms.org/en](https://liberaforms.org/en) - looks more slick but it is newer and they haven't implemented as many question types yet. But this is the only survey tool I know of that is fully open source AND has end-to-end encryption of responses, i.e. the server cannot see responses at all. 
    * [https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/) - looks slightly less slick unless you write custom CSS, but extremely full-featured with tons of question types with branching logic, i.e. follow up questions could be different depending on answers to earlier questions. Developed and hosted by the European Commission to EU privacy standards.

    * Comment: I find it useful to offer interviewees the *option* of using a fully open source videoconferencing tool, rather than giving only one option.

chocolate cheese cake (quantities from memory)


base

- 8oz crushed digestive biscuits

- 2oz butter (melted)

- 3 tblsp golder syrup

- 1 tblsp coco powder (no added sugar)



topping

- 8oz Mascarpone cheese

- 1oz icing sugar

- 6-7oz 70% coco mass chocolate

melt the butter with the golden syrup and mix with the crushed biscuits and coco power in a removable bottom tin, flatten with the back of a spoon and chill in the fridge while preparing the topping.


Melt the chocolate in a Bain-marie then add the icing sugar and Mascarpone keeping the temperature just above the melting point of your chocolate.

pour the topping over the base and chill until well set, allow to warm to near room temperature before serving

THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!
