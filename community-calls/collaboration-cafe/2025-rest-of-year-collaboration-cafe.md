SSI Fellowship Clinic! Open to all existing and prospective SSI Fellows :) 
Make sure to align to the criteria: https://www.software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-09/2026_ShortlistingCriteria.pdf
Make it really easy for the reviewers to check the various boxes on their scoresheets!
Don't over think the video - it shouldn't

Johanna: https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4351
Precious: https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4366

CHAOSS metrics room
Cass and Johanna to acknowledge each others projects
For Cass' Digital Science application
Get steering committee to endorse the community engagement 
They could give a conditional "yes" on using the data of first the consultation 
If for some reason the community doesn't engage, public data analysis can happen in compliance with the license (this de-risks the proposal)
There would need to be a significant financial contribution to recover the old slack. data
Folks might want to see literature on this analysis being done well, with informed consent for historic data. Published academic analysis of slack networks. Need to demonstrate serious value for surveillance 
May be able to explore an anonymised proxy rather than the content of the data itself
The work is also in the operationalisation of frameworks for engagement, particularly low-lift engagement such as attending a meeting! 
What else might we want to quantify from published meeting notes 
Reviewer 2: This is a not a technology question"
The same people are repeatedly overloaded
We need to tools to make this easy and support the culture change to adopt these frameworks
It takes a specific skill integration between RCM and data management 
Want to see that this work is also in service to TTW
Commitment of time to do it by hand while also building the tool
Process for continuous data collection 
Show how a CRM data can be exported to make the map
Hard part would be the protocol of how the data can be captured  (csv updated)
For the Digital Science application, show that this is a research mindset
==Linking RCM - data science skill set ==

Github Gardeners
Both welcoming as well as giving the tools for people to engage with the best practices (upskilling)
It's not a 'github police' but a constructive cocreation-collaboration through the issues
Act as a mentor. Guide the contributor to do what they want, rather than aiming for a particular outcome (or taking over work yourself)
The three above point would be good "guiding principles" for how the gardeners should interact with the community
There is a tricky balance in instructing people how to contribute "better", but not feel like they are being told off +1
If the problem we are solving is 'support people to complete a task', we need the right balance for documentation (detailed enough but not intimidatingly prescriptive)
Step up the upskilling while contributing instead of doing it for them (more mentoring than outcome-oriented)
In terms of responsibility
This is what a "community manager" in FOSS world might do
However, this is too much to put on the CMWG or a single Turing Way CM who have/has many other responsibilities
(Jim's thoughts) What we need (in priority order):
Checklists for gardeners to work through +1
Label for untriaged/triaged items and project board (so team can work through untriaged items first)
Update issue/PR templates
General review, as they still fit for purpose
Add our labels and tag gardener team
Weekly rota for one person to check on every new issue/PR in the past 7 days (and 1 month ago) -anything that's 1 year old backlog would be ideal but --- 
currently looking into monthly lead and support
Would like to make all of the processes public, so that people can join the gardener team. However, this kind of role really benefits from strong and deep knowledge of the project and community. For example, who to tag, how does an idea relate to things already in the book. +1 (this will take some time, but it'll be a beautiful project for new people to contribute)
Name ideas/preferences: GitHub Gardeners (thoughts?) SV: I love it! please, emoji included! 
Disambiguation between backlog review and healthy maintenance checklists?
Split it for new and old stuff?
Growing/sowing - new issues & PRs 
Fertilising - older issues & PRs 
Pruning - closing issues & PRs
Weeding - reshuffling labels and small tweaks
Can we bring this old PR to the stage that is mergeable in the book with today's standards, style guide etc?
What is the equivalent of Malvika's role? (in the sense of having an overview of the book at large and its history as a mental model of the whole). Who decides which issue/PR is stale?
