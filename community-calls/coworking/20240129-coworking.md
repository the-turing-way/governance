## Notes

* Inclusive Events Chapter / PPIE Chapter. 
    * Starting to expand on points specific to members of the public now that we've lifted out sections into the specific PPIE chapter and giving it more space. 
    * It is difficult to know how much to gloss over in terms of accessibility suggestions.
    * Lots of rephrasing and wording tweaks!
* Main Room
    * Introduce people to core infrastructure: pads, and 
    * - Format: The Turing Way, Github, Turing projects, Next stepped
    * - Onboarding: send people out into breakout rooms from the beginning 
    *  - ask people what do they want to know/get involved with TTW, if they have anything in mind?
    *  - Maybe combine the check in-question and then let them discuss it shortly in a breakout room? (What do you want to know about The Turing Way / what do you think you can contribute to The Turing Way / What topics in the book do you find most interesting / something like this)
    * - What will people get from this call that they wouldn't get from other mediums? From other communities?
    * - If the group is less than 10 people, it's nicer to hear what everyone has to say (instead of pairs) 
    * - Not as objective-focused: more of a conversation, guidance of how to get involved, not as much information all at once
    * - Difference between folks might want to learn more about: how to contribute, general conversations, re
    * - MS: Asking “what brings you to Turing Way”, “what would you like to do”, “who would you like to meet”, “is there something you are working on that you wished other knew”
    * - I think, if we can, keeping it fluid so that we can tailor the session on the fly, would be a good way to go
    * - Don't throw too much information -- keep it fluid
    * - Format: 
    * - People don't want to be surprised, cognitive load --> tutorial might be that space (a different call than this one!)
    * - I'd assumed that if folks were just interested in reading they wouldn't sign up to an onboarding
    * so I expect most folks will be looking to contribute (in the broad sense of "contribute")
