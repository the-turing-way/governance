## Notes from Main room: WG and Community Call

* Report out: Infrastructure working group
    * Introduced the roles within WG
    * Representation from WG in leadership
    * Jim has posted a message - may have taken the chair role
* WG may not want to take responsibility of joining the leadership
    * They like the idea of escalating up and disseminating information down
    * Totally up for transparency in governance - but individually may not see themselves engaging with the leadership as an added responsibility
    * If they don't prefer to engage with leadership directly, how do we respect that? Would they be excluded from decision making?
    * Are we demonstrating the types of decision making that we want to advocate for? Can we use The Turing Way as an example for the kind of decision making we want to promote?
* Infra working group might be special in terms of trying to get the things done!
    * They appreciate having discussions turned into decision and requests
* Localisation WG might be different in terms of taking the opportunity to understand where in decision-making they can contribute
* Understanding community-level vs maintainer-level decision making
    * When things should go ahead and when community needs to be involved
* Transitions are important for people to understand
    * We should engage everyone in understanding at what level the decisions are being made (even when they are not involved)
* From 1000 people on Slack, who would like to come along to the community calls? Who would like to have a say in where the decision should be made? Are they not thinking about where the decisions are made?
* Community call to end with 5 years celebration
    * Swag
    * Budget for food: Max per person/per event
    * No travel cost - local event
    * Accessibility fund: internet, child care
* We need to simplify it but not taking the decision making away from the community
