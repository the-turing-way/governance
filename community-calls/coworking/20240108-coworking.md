 ## Notes

* Stakeholder mapping
  * We are doing this work with a view to it being a chapter/section of TTW in relation to RCM, so documenting decisions and processes nicely!
    * cover DPAP and tension between openness and data protection
  * Prioritise projects (rather than institutions) as the key connection and data collection point
  * Don't worry to much about influence-* etc yet, work on filling out the data (collecting folks associated with projects/interactions)
* Skills Policy Award
  * Reviewed the list of people to be interviewed, how and when they will be interviewed. External needs: technical writer, etc
  * Aligned the content of the paper, add the data science personas
  * Discussed the different outputs: policy briefing, podcast
* Inclusive events chapter
  * Discussing a few examples that couple be pulled out as more immediately publishable milestones (i.e. Accessible vs Inclusive section?) 
  * Planning for the upcoming accessibility working group meeting: key questions to ask in planning for restructuring
* RCM paper
  * Reflection on steps towards formalisation of the role in the broader ICT landscape. Similarities with Data Stewardship
