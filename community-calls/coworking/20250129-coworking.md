## Facilitators' Debrief 29 January 2025

* Very good energy and lots of good questions!
* It's a difficult tension between having a 'discussion' space for open questions versus with slides (which can be a easy entry point)
* Interactive element for signing in - can we bring back the social questions?
* Chat can be for asking about TTW, but the check-in question could be more like Collaboration Cafes?
* When do we write on the chat? When do we write on the pad? (It can be confusing: RHXN - the chat could be used for real-time reactions to presentation and check-in, but the pad can be more consciously interactive).
