    * Recording Lightning talk: The Turing Way is an open-source, community-led, and collaboratively developed project on making data science and research skills accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for a wider research community. We bring together individuals from diverse fields and expertise to develop practices and learning resources that can make data research comprehensible and useful for everyone . These resources are organised as an online book with over 250 chapters across five guides on reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication and ethics in research and over 400 contributors total. All questions, comments, recommendations, and discussions are facilitated through an online GitHub repository. This lightning talk will introduce the audience to The Turing Way, and how they can get involved with the project.
