## Call Schedule

Notes: Keeping it fluid so that we can tailor the session on the fly, would be a good way to go (with []rough timing estimates[])

1) Ice-breaker, introductions, conversation (10 -15 min) - Susana \& Anne

*  What brings you here? What projects are you involved in?
2) Slides (15min) - Anne/Susana

*  on how TTW works, glance at github contributions, guide to more collab cafes, who to talk to
*  Slides of community members, contributor 
3) Do you have any ideas on what you'd like to do/contribute with TTW? (15-20min) Susana

*  Asking  “what would you like to do”, “who would you like to meet”, “is there something you are working on that you wished other knew”
4) Any questions on slides, or anything else? (10min) --> opportunity to go into breakout rooms?

5)  Wrap up, feedback - goodbyes (10 min) - Anne

---> plusses and deltas!! "this is your first contribution to the turing way!"

---> would you like to onboard someone in the future?

## Debrief  (to post on Github)

* Biggest group we've had so far - which affected group dynamics slightly! Can we maintain the interactivity, or accept that any expanding group will have a change in dynamics?
* Shorten the introduction: in 1-2 minutes, sharing about yourself and also what brings you to The Turing Way --> updated slide number three
* Trial a new slide: project recognition \& work
* Biggest group we've had so far - which affected group dynamics slightly! Can we maintain the interactivity, or accept that any expanding group will have a change in dynamics?
* New calendar invite on 28th August 2024
* ALS: Review folks to reach out to for new trainers of onboarding calls
* SRG: Review how we use Github issue during the call. maybe people can conribute their interest there, vs feedback in the framapad (ask people to open in incognito).
