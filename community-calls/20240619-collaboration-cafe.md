* Anne + she/they (any work!) + Deep Listening with Pauline Oliveros ([http://archive.soundamerican.org/sa\_archive/sa7/sa7-pauline-oliveros-on-deep-listening.html)](http://archive.soundamerican.org/sa\_archive/sa7/sa7-pauline-oliveros-on-deep-listening.html)) + ðŸ‘‚
* Georgia + she/her - probably something literature related, maybe James Joyce! 
* Kat + she/her/they: I could probably present about accessibility an music (boring answer); my fun answer is that I could probably present on the music of Tom and Jerry between 1929 and the 1950's!
* Malvika + she/her + hmm, good one - I think I'd speak about latest thing I am excited about (can be anything!) -- although, I'd prefer to actually use that time to have sharing circles.
* Noorhan Abbas, are universities going to allow students to use chatGPT freely next year :)
* James + He/Him: The business, economics and politcs of the UK cross-channel ferry industry
* Bastian + he/him + Probably some of my "Personal Science" research efforts (eg. [https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/Impact\_of\_work-related\_stress)](https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/Impact\_of\_work-related\_stress)) 
* Matthew + they/them + Lots of things, though probably something relating to complexity and change! + 
* Renee (Hui Xin) Ng + she/her + anything about dogs
* Marc Goblot
* Esther + she/her + my cats + 
* Jim + he/him + Outsider music, from the most accessible to the least + ðŸŒ»
* Sophia + I am full on panicking as I love presentation parties. I would deffo love to pitch "why we need to read more fiction" because it's a strong passion. I think my major default would always be how to design welcoming VR spaces
* Danny Garside + they/them + One of my faves was a presentation I did (at a powerpoint party, to my US colleagues) on the peculiarities of British food... nobody believed that monster munch were a real thing
* Mishka + she/her + how to become a MUBI enthusiast and how to embrace good cinema in your weekly life
* Batool + (she/her) + I have been reading/reflecting a lot about "performative wokeness" lately, so maybe a talk about that! 
    * would love some links on that if you have some interesting reading!
* Rowan Cockett (He/Him) - ExecutableBooks / JupyterBook / Curvenote
    * Interested to understand more about how Turing Way collaborates, and uses JuptyerBook
    * There are some updates to JupyterBook coming in the coming months and we want to make sure that the Turing Way is well supported.
* Francisco GÃ³mez Medina (He/Him) - 
* Sophie Arana (she/her) - living closer to nature
