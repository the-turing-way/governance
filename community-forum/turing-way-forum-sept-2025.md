## Breakout Discussion - GitHub teams and roles

*In your rooms, please take turns sharing insights and report back on the following prompts to discuss regarding (*[https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4357)](*https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4357)*)



#### We are considering changing our norms around who has write access to the repositories :

   * how could this affect new contributors joining?   
   * What benefits do we see for both contributors and the community long term? 
   * What could the risks be? How could we tackle these?
   * How should we communicate this type of change? 


[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40567468/give-permissions-on-project-folder-in-github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40567468/give-permissions-on-project-folder-in-github)



#### helium

   * For new contributors, maybe not much change. If you are new, the current process is all you know
   * There will be edgecase people where loosing write access shortly after getting it will seem really jarring. Just learned one way of contributing only for it to change
   * Tangible benefits to maintenance
       * Easier to manage
       * More secure
       * More appropriate for the size we are, and the amount of dedicated support we have
   * More realistic/representative workflow. This should do a better job of teaching people how to contribute to other projects
   * We should make sure we explain the workflow. People might find working on their fork and making issues/PRs on the upstream repo confusing.




#### Beryllium

Arielle: support, because reflects open-source norms. But - we need to make sure we update our github training and onboarding to reflect.

Richard - agree with above

Precious - we might need to update the welcome bot- make sure we communicate the changes and WHY these changes are needed



Sarah Gibson: 

- administrative effect on this proposed change: we can share a form to contribute to TTW: GH handle, what do you want to work on/ decision to be made about where this person would sit on/ decide on security level access - end goal: to then have a specific team on GH 



#### Lithium

   * Would this change cause issues in the merge time or cause a backlog in merges, especially smaller, simpler edits?
       * The Gardening group will come in clutch in these kinds of edits
   * Maybe we can give access to a subforlder/chapters such that there are assigned editors for each module
       * [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40567468/give-permissions-on-project-folder-in-github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40567468/give-permissions-on-project-folder-in-github)
       * Jim: "Codeowners is a really nice feature."
   * It's bad practice to merge your own PRs
       * But currently merging is the standard in TTW
   * Gamal shared this article with us: [https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/40-npm-packages-compromised-in-supply.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/40-npm-packages-compromised-in-supply.html) 


Conversations about structure/responsibility like,

- chapter editors

- review team

Helps ensure work gets seen, looked at by people who can help.

Feels related to the access discussion. And we could use similar tools like teams, sub-teams, codeowners, project boards to help with this.

Would also be better for the reviewers. They can focus on helping with PRs relevant to them, rather than being responsible for *all* PRs



Q: Does this hinder participation. Can someone review a PR without permissions?

   * Anyone with read can make a review
   * However, required reviews must come from people with triage or above(?)
Q: Would we loose anything by having fewer people who can do the maintenance work of assigning labels/reviewers

   * Triage role could be useful here, permission to label/assign but not push to repo
Q: What would someone have to do to be granted permissions?



## Notes from Working Groups updates

   * Updates shared on Slidedeck
   * Book Dash: Second meeting. 2 in-person hubs in Netherlands and Aruba. Apply by 10-Oct. Happening from 10th to 14th of November. Need people to volunteer to chair one of sessions
   * Translation and localisation: Next onboarding on 15th - Joining the book dash
   * Accessibility: Compatibility time zones for meetings - Screen reader accessibility - People with lived experience contributing to the accessibility guides - Let them know if any come across funding opportunities for accesibility
   * Infrastructure: New all-contributor maintainers - GH Gardening
   * Community Management: GH Gardners is a merge of the community management and infrastructure - Still figuring out some of the technical details. Sara Villa is joining as Co-Chair -  Gerdeners/maintainers needed. Join #github-gardeners.
   * Data Science Without Borders - Please review book dash specifically the PRs
   * JupyterHub DEI: Report launched! voicesofjupyterhub - need to help make the governance findings more actionable


#### Comments and questions 

   * Precious O: "I think an extra consideration might be designated reviewers, so contributors can know exactly who to tag, and then the task is not left open for an undesignated time."
   * Top level team for reviewers and subteams can be more focused 
   *
