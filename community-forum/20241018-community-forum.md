## üëã Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this pad for collaborative notes)*

* Name / Organisation and location you are joining from / Social media (if you'd like to connect with others) / What book character do you most relate to ‚Äì or which one would you love to be? It could be someone who reflects your personality, inspires you, or a character whose adventure you'd love to experience. Feel free to share why they resonate with you!
   * Lena Karvovskaya / VU Amsterdam (but joining from Delft, the town where I live) / I think I am Sam from the Lord of the Rings - I am a very devoted and loyal person and happy to stand for those I love
   * Kirstie Whitaker / The Alan Turing Institute, London UK / mastodon: @KirstieJane / As I'm mostly reading children's books at the moment I'm going to go with Princess Pearl from Zog
       * I don't want to go back to being a Princess!
       * We love Zog!!!
       * Or maybe Goldie the Gecko from Gecko and the Echo!Such a cute book!!
   * Arielle Bennett / The Alan Turing Institute / @biotechchat / Visiting London,UK from Boston, USA / Ummm when I was younger Lizzie Bennet really resonated with me, now I identify with a lot of Ursula T Kingfisher's protagonists. And I absolutely wanted to be Sophie from the BFG when I was a child. 
       * Omg the BFG! Love!
   * Esther Plomp / Delft University of Technology, The Hague / [https://scholar.social/@toothFAIRy](https://scholar.social/@toothFAIRy)
   * Sarah Gibson / 2i2c / gh: @sgibson91 / Rachel Morgan from The Hollows series. Bad-a** bounty hunter and witch. All the books are variations on Clint Eastwood films 
       * I can totally see you as a bounty hunter and witch 
   * Jim Madge / The Alan Turing Institute / @jimmadge@fosstodon.org / The very hungry caterpillar (?)
   * Anne Lee Steele / The Alan Turing Institute / @aleesteele / London, UK / This is totally aspirational, but maybe Sabriel from the Abhorsen series?!? And weirdly, Anna Karenina...?
       * I am so curious, why Anna? I think it's the family epic aspect maybe more than her in particular - the drama, joy, connection, all of it!
   * Ella Kaye / University of Warwick and rainbowR / Oxford, UK / Mastodon: [https://fosstodon.org/@ellakaye](https://fosstodon.org/@ellakaye) / [https://ellakaye.co.uk](https://ellakaye.co.uk) / [https://rainbowr.org](https://rainbowr.org) / (I'm going to keep thinking about the book question!)
   * Malvika Sharan / The Alan Turing Institute / Lonson - Turing office / I love love the character Moscap (robot that comes from a line of liberated robot) in Monk and Robot series!
   * Lelle Demertzi / The Alan Turing Institute / London, Turing office / no socials / Throughout my 20s it was Meursault from L'Etranger by Camus / www.lelledi.com 
       * Such a good character!!
   * Richard J. Acton / HDBI - Babraham Institute / @RichardJActon@fosstodon.org / thinking... as a kid would have loved to be artemis fowl+1! Such a good character.
   * Batool Almarzouq / Liverpool /Romeo in Romeo's Blue Skies (ÿπŸáÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµÿØŸÇÿßÿ°)

   * Liz Hare she/her, I love fiction but don't usually think in those terms. 
   * Renee (Hui Xin) Ng/UC San Diego + UCL/@\_slowlettuce / I haven't read fiction in a long time 


## **Breakout discussions**

### Prompts

* Each person has about 1-2 minutes to share their experience/thoughts based on one of the following prompts:
   * If you've attended Book Dash before: Share your favorite memory from the event. It could be a moment that stood out, an exciting collaboration, or something meaningful you created!
   * If you‚Äôre attending in November: What are you most looking forward to? Whether it‚Äôs the creative process, meeting like-minded people, or the joy of storytelling, we want to hear what excites you!
   * If you were attending: What kind of project or collaboration would you have loved to be a part of? Maybe you have a story idea or a dream team you‚Äôd like to work with.

### Notes from the part 1: 

* Governance Updates
   * Kirstie will be leaving the Turing.
       * What does that mean for The Turing Way?
           * The Turing is still funding The Turing Way: Malvika will take on the project as a PI (currently co-lead), Anne, Lelle and part of Arielle's time.
           * Kirstie will continue to contribute and in the long term hopes to get her next employer (whenever she knows) - to fund and support The Turing Way.
   * We have been multi-stakeholder governance already
       * Carlos from eScience, Lena from VU Amsterdam and Esther from TU Delft have buy in from their oganisation to use a few hours of their employment time to work on Turing Way
           * Each have participated in Book Dash, hosted local hub and created resources that are in direct benefit for their organisation
   * How do I set up a partnership with The Turing Way with my institution? How much is that relationship reliant on individuals as opposed to or in complement to institutions?
       * What does this mean for the sustainability of The Turing Way? What does this mean for sustainability and support for open source projects broadly?
       * How can we support more such model? Do we need structured support?
       * National and institutional buy in
           * I'm organising a barcamp session for a conference on Monday exactly on this - how to get institutional support for your shiny stuff - Esther 
           * Official commitment from an institution might actually help people to devote their time to the Turing Way
       * Sarah: what methodlogy and approaches should we apply to get buy in?
           * How do we convince them? What is the business case? We have good opportunity to explore this more.
           * The talk I referenced [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ9LQR\_j0Rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ9LQR\_j0Rk)
   * Jim: It has been great to have paid positions for maintenance of The Turing Way
       * People have been able to use Turing affiliation to support work like infrastructure, book dash (even outside the team)
       * There is a good case to make that this should be funded!
   * Kirstie:
       * We can be creative at getting organisation to express what they want
           * Logo, being able to tell people that they suppor this project
           * Professional development and upskilling -- allowing staff to raise their profile, increasing reach - network we are a part of.
       * Name is sometimes a challenge
           * Turing in the name can miguide people - where they may think it is associated with Turing
           * How do we help organisation to dismantle that notion -- this is an important conversation
               * Not working at the Turing and being able to do that will be 
           * We should use Turing in the name as the same as Budapest Declaration of Open Access or other things that started somewhere
               * The way talk about Turing in the project presentation can be revised
   * We should continue having this conversation in Slack.
   * SG: CNCF is a good example of this for organisations working with each other on open source cloud stuff

### Notes from the part 2: 

* Working group
   * Translation awesome-list repository is such an interesting idea - how to put information about the workflow and reuse it
   * Links and other announcements to look out for:
       * Review our Accessibility Policy: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3581/files](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3581/files) 
       * Watch the Fireside Chat: [https://youtu.be/Ac9czT3Tr8A](https://youtu.be/Ac9czT3Tr8A) 
       * Read the Inclusive events for PPIE chapter: [https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/ppie-events](https://book.the-turing-way.org/collaboration/ppie-events)
   * What does transferring the chair role from Danny to Jim look like?
