## üì£ Updates from the project

*Please take any notes, leave comments and ask question below*

### Notes from the presentations

#### **Infrastructure Working Group**

* PR: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509)
* When migrating away from Netlify (back end for hosting the book) - what features do you consider essential?
    * For example preview for Pull request (that we get with Netlify)
    * Hosting multilingual versions
* What sub domains people prefer
    * for example: 
        * for Book: book.the-turing-way.org
        * for blog: blog.the-turing-way.org

##### Notes

* Which Open Source tools is the infrastructure team considering, the pros and cons.  
    * A lot of factors we want to balance 
* What was the concern with Netlify (it isn't open source), very old Python / readthedocs you don't really control the stack either. It is a step up, but has similiar problems.
* How can someone who is not technical support the WG?
    * Help us understand what features/automation people need
    * Suggest URL redirects or services you would like to see (a blog, video hosting, and more.)
    * From Q\&A: 
        * JM: Suggestions for services (i.e. blog, next cloud synchronisation), ideas for sub-domains, feature requests (i.e. for translation and localisation). But don't want people to think that this can only come from the Infra WG. We worry about how to do things, so feedback on implementation is welcome.

**Questions:**

* CH: We are currently migrating TO netlify so I am intrigued that you are migrating away. Is there a tl;dr on this?
    * SG: I personally found Netlify to be painful to work with. There was a config file, and stuff that you could change in the UI. It wasn't clear what could be changed where, what overwrote what, and it made responding to outages (the book is down) really painful from a site reliability engineering POV.
    * ALS: Here‚Äôs the platform audit that we did of a few different options, which shows the comparison we did between a few different platforms: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509) 
    * From Q\&A: 
        * SG: Difficult to work with Netlify UI, and made working with project difficult. Netlify doesn't support newer version of python.
        * I don‚Äôt think we have a brief overview (maybe we should!) but there is discussion here [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3509) and here [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2481](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2481)
* Are the multilingual options actually dependent on the hoster?
    * Not by design, maybe some hosting providers have additional features but none that I know of.

#### **Proposal for Communications Working Group**

* Communications Working Group proposal: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3622](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3622)
* What does open communication mean to you?
* *How can community get involved in community-level decision-making through open communication?*  
* Room2: it is a good question because something like a newsletter you know that someone had that "power" to integrate it. In an open source project how to decide what is newsworthy -- Exciting mess
* Newsletter is a summary of what is happening and if I see something interesting there I can go deep in there and contact the people or found out the details. There are no hidden communications channel, from the outside I can find details, without waiting for more information to arrive or asking people. It's OK to ask where info is but the info should be accessible.
* How are the decisions being made around what makes information newsworthy?   
    * Moderation? Who is making cuts and organising the data. If we work openly, it should be easy to communicate.
* Newsletter: list of links: [https://tldr.tech/](https://tldr.tech/)

**Notes**

* CH: I am more and more moving towards appreciating open comms as communicating towards an audience, and finding what that audience needs.
    * ALS: This is really interesting Chris - like ‚Äòaudience-centric‚Äô or ‚Äòcommunity-centric‚Äô communications? Sounds like user centred design!
    * MS: Can you say more CH? As in, is that through creating multiple ways to access information (as audience) and maintaining regularity (as person sharing information)? Or something else?
    * CH: I was getting at people communicating what they want to say (communicating A => B) instead of helping others understand what you are trying to say (A <=> B)
        * But what you're saying Malvika is 100% an extension of that. Different audiences/people have different needs for successful communication - what works for B may not for C.
    * MS: So setting clear guidance/norm for how and where people can share what they want to openly (and respectfully).
* ALS: Decentralising communications is a difficult one ‚Äì as it involves managing different accounts \& schedules that can be difficult to decentralise to multiple people. But for me, it often translates into the voice ‚Äì can people have agency in shaping how their work is communicated? How do you all think about it?
    * CH: Great point - I find my agency augmented by clear frameworks/instructions - it focuses ideas/creativity. I used to think flexibility enables creativity, and sometimes it actually hampers it.
    * CH: A great facilitator I know calls this constructive selfishness - articulating what you want so people can better fulfill that need, which makes them feel more useful too :-)
    * VH: I think as you said some things will be difficult to decentralise and perhaps shouldn't be (e.g event invites etc) but I like the example you did a while ago of letting the data hazards team write their own comms/tweets for their new chapter
    * MS: That‚Äôs a good point. If something is challenging (and shouldn‚Äôt be) ‚Äî good question is to ask what can make it easier for people to communicate.
        * Rather than accounts, can people share easily and find information easily where they are (rather than managing communications - which is what the team can do). That‚Äôs good example of clear pathway and ask for what community can do and where for example community manager takes on to amplify their information.
    * ALS: Thanks Vicky! Interestingly - this seems really tied to Chris‚Äôs point as well. Because the decentralised comms had a very explicitly scoped ask, it seemed more valuable than multiple folks having access to the comms platforms.
    * MS: Guidance and examples are what I am leaning to ‚Äî making it ‚Äútoo easy not to do‚Äù. 
    * ALS: Totally think we were saying similarly things there in different ways (and posting at the same time) Malvika! So true!
* Ahmed found finding the project easy, project is very open.
* How to get involved?
    * Do we sign post that well enough?
    * Do new contributors need onboarding?
    * There is information that we may not write down, which is needed to contribute. For example infrastructure configuration. More policy/guidance/rules could help ensure we write these things down.
    * Is this part of the remit of a communications WG?
* CH: Can I also shout out that Turing Way is consistently one of the best at open communications? ü•≥ The theory is one thing but the practice is another- y'all actually DO it!
    * ‚ù§Ô∏è

#### Practitioners hub update

* Scaling the impact of The Turing Way: currently in the UK, but wanting to expand (more soon!)
* First cohort of experts in residence represented different sectors
* 2024 - 2025 Cohort for expression of Interest is now open:
    * Expressions of interest form for EiR: [https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=p\_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-Y7Akle7QvZEgPbWyXh31R9UNzhNQVFHV0VNMTNON0tTTlVBWjZQQUsxNi4u](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=p\_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-Y7Akle7QvZEgPbWyXh31R9UNzhNQVFHV0VNMTNON0tTTlVBWjZQQUsxNi4u)

**Open Discussion**

* DG: What worked out really well last time?
* AAA: One of the appointed experts was very excited about the open practices that we were discussing in all the discussions that they decided to open up their own company about open practices. So this is a good response and demonstrates the need to meet more people about open practices. With [the Office of National Statistics] (another example), they interviewed many teams to capture the way they implement open practices. Most of the experts in the residence have a cultural problem of managing risk. So it was interesting to see the risk mitigation practices they took to have open practices, because there were many concerns.
