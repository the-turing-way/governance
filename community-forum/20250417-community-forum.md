## 👋 Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this pad for collaborative notes)*
Name / Organisation and location you are joining from / What is one thing you have learned as a result of working with large teams or open source/science communities?
   * Chanju / The Alan Turing Institute, London / **Reproducibility is hard!**
   * Sara/ OLS- London/ stop being afraid to ask: no one judges and the **answer you seek will be out there with someone**! 
   * Alexandra / The Alan Turing Institute  - London / **collaboration takes time but once people get to know each other, the magic starts**
   * Kirstie / she/her / Berkeley Institute for Data Science, California, USA / How important it is to **keep saying thank you and communicating** (over and over and over) the work that's being done
   * Anne + she/her + Alan Turing Institute + **Patience for working at the speed of trust** (and the responsibility that comes with facilitation and trust in shared spaces)
   * Liz she/her, too many orgs to name, **Importance of written  documentation and conversations** 
   * Lelle + she/her + London, The Alan Turing Institute / One learning: building a shared language takes time, getting on the same page about the team's objectives and members' priorities can be more challenging than it sounds.** It is very important to take this time within team-building to create shared understandings **
   * Malvika + she/her + London + Documentation is very empowering, clarity is kindness. Also, c**ourage sometimes means being open when nobody else around you is practicing openness**
   * Arielle + she/her + Boston, MA, The Alan Turing Institute + the importance of transparency around decision making! **No matter what the model is, writing it down so people can see is empowering**. 
   * Precious + she/her + DSWB, Nigeria + The importance of** factoring in cultural differences, navigating them, and the importance of accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. **
   * Esther Plomp + she/her + University of Aruba, Aruba + documentation is key!

## Breakout Discussion - Collective Brainstorming

**Use the following prompts to guide discussions:**
   * What good practices of maintenance and sustainability in open science or community projects have you seen in other projects? What of those practices and models can we bring into *The Turing Way*?
   * How can we build diverse sources of funding and sustainability in *The Turing Way*?

### Notes
**Group  1: Sara, Esther \& Anne**
   * Discussing different organisations we have turned towards (actively engaged and lurking): OpenAIRE, OLS, FOSDEM open research devroom, Open Knowledge Foundation network, OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, SocRSE
   * Does working on governance affect the ability to output other kinds of information? Ie will you inevitably have less outputs if you are prioritising internal structures vs external updates?
   * 99% volunteer communities have different outputs. 
   * Size of community affects the structure. 

**Group  2: Chanju, Arielle, Liz, Léllé**
   * Inputs from accross the community to strengthen stratetgic planning (the whole community should be engaged!)
   * AI \& Arts Commons - event self-organised by members, more engagement in the meetings 
   * Better backing up of data that supports the Turing Way 
   * Learning from Jupyter about transitioning Steering Council and taking on fiscal responsibility

**Group 3: Ale, Precious, Carolina, Kirstie**
   * We mostly said hello and introduced oursleves
       * And that is a learning - important to KEEP saying hello and KEEP introducing ourselves and the project - easy to forget how many people don't know! 😍❤️🙌
   * Talked about federal funding drops in the USA
   * How can we build diverse sources of funding and sustainability in *The Turing Way*?
       * Donations
       * Have for-profit organizations who make use of our resources sometimes pay a token?
       * Host some paid classes with more senior people in the community to share their knowledge/give insight into some topics existing in the book.
       *
