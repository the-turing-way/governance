## üëã Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this pad for collaborative notes)*

* Name / Organisation and location you are joining from / What is one thing you have learned as a result of working with large teams or open source/science communities?
   * Malvika  Sharan / The Turing Way, London / Teach by showing how working and collaborating in the open looks like!
   * Kirstie Whitaker / Berkeley Institute for Data Science, California, USA / how valuable it can be to "just" ask someone how they are doing!
   * Kathe Todd-Brown / University of Florida / Different teams make decisions in different ways, often not explicitly stated, and it's important to know how your team operates!
   * Jim Madge / Exeter, UK / It is also very fun to help others reach their goals, as well as working on your own
   * Esther Plomp / University of Aruba, Aruba / They keep me happy in weird timesüíØ
   * Lara Muffley / AVE Alliance \_University of Washington- Seattle / community management is like tending a garden
   * Alexandra Araujo Alvarez / The Alan Turing Institute, based in London but connected to day from Lisbon/ I've witnessed the powerful of collaboration and the power of including more voices into processes can make it impactful
   * Lelle Demertzi / The Alan Turing Institute / Creating a common vocabulary takes time, but it's an essential investment so that people are on the same page
   * Arielle Bennett / The Alan Turing Institute / aligning around share practices and norms is so important to create a sense of community! (and you might also learn a new way of approaching tasks) 
   * Patricia Herterich / OLS / That documentation is important so people somehow follow the same processes (too much documentation though and people stop reading)
   * Andrea S√°nchez Tapia / That some roles or activities can be overseen as less exciting but they actually keep everything working
   * Zo√´ Turner / NHS / that working with people in the open source/science community space can be so satisfying and supportive.
   * Batool Almarzouq / The Alan Turing Institute /
   * Saranjeet Kaur / 
   * Alejandro Coca-Castro / the Alan Turing Institute / Don't feel shy, every single contribution counts!
   * Anton Molina
   * Sara Villa/ OLS, London/ how much you can learn by just asking and how much grace people show with even beginners questions. Really, how much community feeling there is!
   * Liz she/her New York City, multiple roles/orgs, communities ththat are intentional about respectful interaction are effective and funun. And important when times get hard.

## Breakout Discussion - Collective Brainstorming

* Use the following prompts to guide discussions:
   * What role has *The Turing Way *played in the research landscape and community?
   * What specific gaps in skills, practices, or culture does *The Turing Way* fill?
   * What impact have you observed, whether personally, within your institution, or more broadly? How can we ensure its continued impact?

### Notes

* Group  1: Alejandro, Alexandra, Andrea and Arielle
   * Research landscape, reference about OpenScience, a space and community to discuss/learn how to do thing correctly. It goes beyond the content of the chapters. +1
   * Impact about good practices in many chapters and spaces in reproducibility and sustainability. Lots of impact of setting the right standards on reproducibility 
   * A space to ask questions and get interesting answers from different
   * Skills: Version control knowledge and trainings, having many and different perspectives makes it more elaborated terms and more accessible
       * Accessibility tools
       * Satellite of tools, beyond reproducibility and open science, such as ethics, governance, etc connect themes that are extremely relevant

* Group  2: Lara, L√©ll√©, Jim
   * Lara found The Turing Way through CSCCE [https://www.cscce.org](https://www.cscce.org)
   * A lot of people find The Turing Way through that community or scientific community managers
   * Important resource for people working in open science, possibly lots of readers and lurkers
   * Feels like an important learning and teaching resource
   * Particularly for open science, reproducibility, ethics, EDI, which are not as well served as, for example, programming tutorials, technical documentation
   * May become more valuable to people in the USA due to EDI becoming impossible to fund
       * We may see people wanting to join/contribute from the USA as they become unable to continue work there
       * How can we support that?
   * EDI is imbedded across the book and community. It is itself a demonstration of those principles, unlike more dry/performative EDI discussions

* Group  3
   * We couldn't remember how we found out about The Turing Way as researchers but that it was one of the first references for how to do open science
   * Code of Conduct was called out as particularly useful for patterning after in other groups
   * There were some curiosities on how to connect with other domains (non-medical) and regions (beyond Europe and USA)

* Group 4: Liz, Patricia, Richard and Kirstie
   * Understanding the praxis of collaboration - not just why you would want to work with others but HOW to work with others
   * A feeling of belonging - 
   * A feeling of empowerment
   * Advocacy for inclusion efforts - making sure that 
   * Advocacy for reproducibility: what skills are needed across the research ecosystem in version control, testing, continuous integration
   * Advocacy for open source / open scholarship practices - helping to understand how multidimensional open practices are - disentangle the different facets
   * The book is a conduit to several other projects and organisations
   * Shared chapters in the book in the book with the ManyDogs project - able to be more specific and concrete about how to work together rather than either a) create norms from scratch or b) work without that guidance
   * Research Infrastructure Roles - the Turing Way team showcased the value of these roles
       * My (Richard's) role as "data outputs manager" might be a good example
       * Supporting the HiddenREF and other initiatives
   * The book is continually updated - in contrast to many pieces of guidance that are created but then not updated.
   * The book - and community! - evolves meaning it stays up to date with the current conversations and needs

## Notes from Constitution Level Update

* Adopting three institution levels across all operations: Community - Maintenance - Constitution level 
   * Who joins the Steering Committee? -  Issue No: 4014 [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4014](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4014)
       * Chairs of WGs 
       * Appointed members

       * Software Sustainability Institute Fellows
       * JupyterHub - TTW project (CZI)
       * Datas Science without Borders
   * Working groups: decision making for processes explicit for the community so the community members can identify how certain decisions are being made.

#### Comments and questions 

* Questions from the chat:
   * What are the obligations of DG to TTW and how are they ‚Äòcertified‚Äô as TTW?
       * Relatedly how is funding and personal time dealt with?
   * What about working groups? Does this mean that these are 'closed' now, and is there the possibility to create a new one?
       *  how is membership defined for these working groups and how are people added/removed to that membership? How are members on/offboarded
   * Comments:
   * Representation from the 4 working groups
   * To create a new working group: minimum three members (chair, treasurer, secretariat)
   * Any discussion from the steering committee is first reviewed by community before being approved (commenting period 6-8 weeks)
   * Combination of founding members with deep institutional knowledge and empowering newer members to take leadership steps
   * Collaboration cafes are a good place to have meaningful discussions and taking decisions within community
   * We acknowledge there will be some trial and error within the first period (6-12 months)
   * Suggested time of tenure of the steering committe : minimum 1 year, ideal 3 years (with openness and flexibility)
   * Key difference between delivery and working group, is that DG has external accountability from TTW (e.g in-kind contribution or funding). We cannot expect performance management for example for a voluntary community. Another distinction is documentation -certain processes or policies that are required by the partner and are of sensitive nature
   * Different decision making process are distinct for initiating a working group (no funding/lower stakes) vs delivery group (funding/associated accountability)
