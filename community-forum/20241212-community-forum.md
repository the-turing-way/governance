## **Breakout discussions**

### Prompts - **Community level governance**

* Each person has about 1-2 minutes to share their experience/thoughts:
   * What has been your individual success as part of The Turing Way community?
   * What is one thing about your experience you would like to preserve/maintain?
   * What is one thing you would like to improve/fix?

### Notes

* Success: 
   * how the community creates space for everyone to contribute with valuable work, how people from different backgrounds learn from each other and inspire each other.
   * we look at things at the larger scale, but we do not forget to celebrate the smaller wins
   * new chapter on cultural change - taken from discussion to chapter!
   * new accessibility policy merged! \& HiddenREF commendation - Turing Way Community provides a space to do the work of helping people to learn how to enter the community and lower barriers to participation
   * Issue about image management in the turing way
   * discovering The Turing Way! I found it when looking for a "Way" book and copied the concept for NHS-R Community. That led to the community calls so led to getting involved with a great community.

*  Maintain: 
   * regular opportunities to get together and collaborate
   * openness of the process and receptiveness to feedback
   * conversations on GitHub where all things are discussed. I used a lot of the information shared on things like event management systems so this was really useful and easy to find.

* Preserve:
   * Focus on enabling people to contribute. We sincerely want to help people get involved
   * space where we can teach each other how to have a community 

* Improve/Fix: 
   * wish we had more time to work on TTW, next to everything else -the endless need for more productivity
   * Some more formality around what permissions people have, how contributors "should" work could help maintain quality and make joining less intimidating
   * sometimes can get distracted by things (Book Dash sessions, working group meetings) and the content falls behind 
   * how do newer members find the documentation they need? Is it clear enough how to onboard?
   * clarity around progressing discussion to action (project board should help with this)
   * There is so much information and navigating it is hard, particularly in GitHub. The Carpentries have refined their labels after discussions with people and that might be useful to do in The Turing Way or to copy.

### WG updates and celebrations - M**aintenance level governance**

Updates shared in the slidedeck

### HiddenREF Celebrations

* Congratulations to Hidden REF high commendations and nominations! Submissions were co-written with Working Group chairs: Esther, Arielle, Emma, Jim, Brigitta, Sarah, Danny, and Liz!
