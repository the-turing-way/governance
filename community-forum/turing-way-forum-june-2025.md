## 👋 Icebreaker

*(Getting to know each other and this pad for collaborative notes)*

Name / Organisation and location you are joining from / What is one thing you have learned as a result of working with large teams or open source/science communities?

   * Lelle Demertzi / The Alan Turing Institute / London / It takes time to create a common vocabulary, but it is such a necessary step for the health and sustainability of the community
   * Oscar Seip / SSI - University of Manchester/ Manchester / don't start alone
   * Danny Garside / n/a, Aachen, Germany / That's a big question...!
   * Sara Villa/ OLS \& TTW; London/ kind of learned A LOT but to begin with...: the more you collaborate, the more you create
   * Kirstie Whitaker / Berkeley Institute for Data Science, Berkeley, CA / Its incredible how much creativity can come from a group of people volunteering their time and feeling empowered to suggest ideas
   * Michael Donnay / Software Sustainability Institute, UK / usually Edinburgh, but Washington DC for a wedding this week / collaborations take way more time than solo working

Steering Committee written introductions

   * Emma Karoune - Hi 👋, I'm a Principal Researcher at The Alan Turing Institute and lead of the Research Coommunity Management Team. I have been contributing to The Turing Way since I joined the November 2020 bookdash. I have personally contributed to The Turing way to share data science and open research best practices that I have learnt about and used in my community building and research work. It is also a great project to increase visibility of advocacy work in open research and gain awareness in other related communities, such as our work around research infrastructure roles. I represent the Book Dash working group on the steering committee and I want to make sure others are able to continue joining this wonderful, collaboborative community event. 
       * My ideal for shaping the governance in The Turing Way is transparency - I want to ensure that all our processes and decision in the Turing Way are transparent, so we are able to empower our community and therefore fully living up to our community-led approach.   
       * I would like to help to bring in some funding to ensure we are able to run the book dash events to the same standard that we have done previously - ensuring we have enough money to provide an accessibility fund and also run in person hubs around the globe.  
   * Batool Almarzouq
       * 1: I am Batool, I have met many of those in the call. If we have not met, I have joined the Turing way back in 2020, currently leading the localisation and translation working group. This is something I mentioned many times, but The Turing Way is a community that inspired a lot of the work I do on different open science grassroots activities, I take a lot from the practices, processs and build on them in different spaces. it also a sauce that allow me \& empower me to bring my thoughts and reflections back to. One thing that I will be focusing allowing more shared ownership. It’s defiantly a space that I felt in belonging and wanted to share and extend this experience to everyone esocillay in the translation and localisation working group.. 
       * 4: As I mentioned, each working group has autonomy in the way they govern their working group. We at the localisation, we have the joy of working with most diverse members who each has speak very different language but also have different mental model of what inclusivity, transparancy, accessibility in OS means. The localisation WG started before the current structure of WGs (or now delivery group) in TTW takes place.  We always trying to review some of our structures and allow more sense of shared ownership, I am always reflecting on how to rotate leadership within the working group, what pathways leads people to progress within the localisation working group from translator to leaders. 
           * *I think everyone in this call share the sentiment that we want place where people understand the process and feel able to challenge it when they need to.*
       * 5: I think we would benefit from **redefining autonomy within working groups**, while keeping these structures **transparent and based on shared agency**.
           * This could lead to greater sustainability — and by sustainability, I don’t just mean funding. I’d like us to reflect on our current processes and shift toward enabling others, especially those working outside the GitHub space.
           * In particular, I’d like to **support translators** who contribute to localisation but may not yet be fully integrated into the core processes. I believe we can open up **new pathways for growth and leadership within the localisation working group**, and that’s something I’d feel genuinely proud of.
   * Liz: I found The Turing Way  because I was working on a big team dog cognition research project, the ManyDogs Project. I was interested in learning about things like reproducibility and collaborating on data management and analysis code. I found a community that was intentional about inclusion and accessibility, and this made me want to contribute resources on these topics gathered from colleagues who had personal experience working in these areas or being excluded.  We’ve gotten a lot done including framing an accessibility policy and working on TTW’s transition to being an independent organization, but I’d like to get back to creating content, which means finding people with content to share and funding.
   * Anne Lee Steele
       * 1.1 Hey everyone! I'm the Research Community Manager of The Turing Way (until the end of June!) and have been since March 2022 (a little more than 3 years ago - wow!). I've been embedded with different working groups at different points throughout the project, supporting their incubation for some (like the Accessibility Working Group, Infrastructure Working Group, and Book Dash Working group) and institutionalisation (Translation and Location Working Group). My focus right now on supporting and co-chairing Community Management Working Group with Lelle to pass on vital institutional, operational and community knowledge to an amazing group of leaders across The Turing Way. It's been such a joy to witness their confidence grow, and I'm excited to see them contribute to the culture of care that will carry us into the next chapter!
       * 2.1: Over the next few months, the Steering Committee is focused on laying the groundwork for a sustainable, community-lead future for The Turing Way. Our goals are support leadership transitions for paid staff into other roles, and decentralize the strategic and visionary work of The Turing Way community towards community leaders. Ultimately we are building towards long term resilience of the project and community. More specifically: documentation, meeting cadence, strategic conversations, responsibilities, roles so that we don't fall prey to the 'tyranny of structurelessness' at the leadership level. We're already getting there! From the Community Management Working Group perspective, I'm keen to get folks involved and embedded across the various aspects of the projects - to have a decentralized network of folks (the mycelium!) acting as binding structures across the project, becoming empowered in their own leadership of the project.
       * 2.2: In five years time, I hope that The Turing Way will be thriving as a truly distributed, community-led project - one where decision-making is shared across our diverse, globally-distributed leadership. My hope that is that people feel a strong sense of ownership and care for The Turing Way, and the work of building resources for more inclusive and open data-driven research. Ultimately, I hope that the structures we are building today will serve as scaffolding for this vital work, and carry it forward. (With this in mind - I hope we have a whole new set of faces here in 5 years' time!)
       * Closing: Beyond my capacity as a paid RCM on the project (before I join as a regular community member!), I hope to leave behind a legacy of a community management that other folks feel like they can confidently take it forward! If contributors of the Community Management Working Group can say: "I felt welcomed, trusted and empowered to lead because Lelle and Anne made space for me", then I know we'll have done something meaningful. 
   * Léllé Demertzi - 1. Hi folks! I'm a Research Project Manager at The Alan Turing Institute and I joined The Turing Way in September 2024. I have been part of the BookDash Working Group for two BookDashes, and recently I started cochairing the newly-founded Community Management Working Group with Anne, which I represent at the Steering Committee. I'm also a member of the Practitioners Hub Delivery Group. 
       * 1.2. My ideal for shaping the governance of The Turing Way is inclusivity and breaking down the barriers of participation. Every contribution is meaningful, allowing numerous community members to take initiative and shape processes within the WGs, regardless of their background or expertise. In order to engage meaningfully, mentoring and empowering of the community is crucial to form a truly community-led project.
       * 5. Closing: I am committed to a seamless transition of the project out of institutional support. Preserving the continuity of activities and engagement opportunities within the community is my top priority. The Community Management Working Group will undertake many of the operational aspects previously supported by funded roles, and with the guidance of the Steering Committee will shape how we convene, exchange, collaborate, and make decisions openly.
   * **Kirstie Whitaker:**
       * 1:1 - Hi Everyone, I'm Kirstie Whitaker - I founded the Turing Way in 2018 as part of the AI for Science and Government funding to the Turing Institute. The prompt then was to come up with an idea that a) wasn't traditionally / commonly funded, b) could start quickly, and c) could show impact in 6 months. Working openly meant we hit all of those needs - and I think we've moved the needle on making projects like these MORE likely to be funded! On the Steering Committee I represent the JupyterHub DEI funding that was awarded as part of one of the CZI Essential Open Source Software for Science. Our goal is to both support the JupyerHub team to be more inclusive - particularly focusing on inclusive leadership - and to capture those learnings in The Turing Way to allow other projects to benefit. A way of not "inventing" how to lead an open source project, but a pathway to \_disseminating\_ that knowledge. My vision for The Turing Way is the same as it always has been, and it is even more relavent to my new role as executive director for the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. Our mission is to foster and facilitate open and collaborative research.
       * 1.2 - I'd consider an ideal success for the governance of The Turing Way is to have as few decisions happen at the "top" (constitutional) level as possible. There really should only be questions that are particularly thorny or complex that make their way up to that level. What that looks like in practice is empowering the working and delivery groups to know what is inside of their power to decide.
       * 2.2 - I hope that in 5 years time we're going to have a "problem" of too many delivery groups meaning we can't give every single one of them a role on the steering committee and also that there are contested elections for all of the working groups. That would indicate that we've found lots of different ways to fund people to work on / with The Turing Way (delivery groups) and that the working groups are really delivering something valuable not just for The Turing Way but ALSO for the individual members. So for example if we can demonstrate that being a member of a working group is not just a kind thing that you do for The Turing Way BUT ALSO that it benefits your career - gives you more options for next jobs / supports finding funding etc.

       * 1.1
           * - Jim Madge
           * - Work as a Research Software Engineer
           * - Passionate about open source
           * - Like film, cycling, photography, knitting
           * - Chair of the Infrastructure WG, manage the tools and services that keep the book working
           * - Quite a technical group, with software and infrastructure engineering experience
       * 1.2
           * - Naturally, we have opinions on processes, best practice and quality control
           * - I think it is important to find balance and compromise, keeping a focus on the purpose of our community
       * 3
           * - The Turing Way as a sustainable, community-run project
           * - That means, we have a strong and dedicated "core team" to maintain the book
           * - Importantly, in the spirit of The Turing Way, we will have open documentation on that work, enabling others to join
           * - Being independent, means we have freedom to set our own agenda
           * - And being independent with good and transparent governance will give organisations the confidence to work with us
           * - And so, I hope we will become "self-sufficient", able to operate independently, but also being seen as a more attractive collaborator, a responsible community not a project of The Turing Institute
       * 5
           * - I'm hoping to bring the expertise of the infrastructure WG to the governance we build
           *     - Introducing some formality and best practice to benefit quality and give contributors good experience for contributing to other projects
           *     - Build a team of maintainers who triage issues/PRs/discussions
